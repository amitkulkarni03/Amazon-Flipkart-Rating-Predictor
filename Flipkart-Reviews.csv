137,5,"Writing this review after 5 days of use and i would say I really like this product and i got it at 37k with exchange and other discount.
Let me tell you my perspective gaming was not my priority but why i choose this because based on my research and cost prediction I was getting other i5 laptop within same range,so why not choose a laptop with graphics card??. Secondly upgradbility you can put multiple ssd,hdd which u really can't do with other laptop and it gives you accessories to put SSD ..."
138,5,"This is a very good laptop I bought it for 43k in sail
It gives the best performance don't expect battery life from this after it is a gaming laptop because it gives the good performance.display also good one.you can go for it🥳"
139,5,Of first look it's awesome. If u like a plain design then it's best for you. Performance is awesome but there's one problem the battery it's 45wh it would be better if it was 75hw Or more anyways it is a best budget gaming laptop who don't want to invest a large amount of money. Go for it
140,4,"Good looking with fast boot time(less than 5 sec), 16 gb ram with ryzen 5500u is enough to handle any software. It claims more battery backup still provides average backup (3-5 hr max).

trackpad is best in this price segment and Backlight is good and practical.

Superb display. to protect your oled display, hide task bar and change walpaper frequently, if listening songs then put a dynamic screen. Anything static on screen with more screen time can cause burn issue.

Got it @50900 in sale"
141,4,"Light weight laptop for office work and light gaming in low graphics.
The display is nice, the overall performance is decent and sufficient for the price point it's coming at(~60k).
The battery is not that great, max 3hours.
The fingerprint scanner and boot time is pretty fast.
The build is not that great, external keyboard and mice advised."
142,5,A very great thing from ASUS The most important thing of this laptop that I like is it's display. The colour contrast every is very nice.
143,5,"The product was delivered at a wonderful condition (open box delivery). The boot time is super fast (max 1 min) and the day to day performance is good.
Battery lasts for about 4-5 hrs (could have been better for such a high performance laptop)
Normal tasks occur at jet speeds thanks to the Ryzen 5 5500U, and the display!!!
The display packs a punch for watching movies. It looks incredible with accurate colour saturation. Great laptop overall!
(Do be mindful there isn't any HDD to this in-built)"
144,5,"The Laptop is nice and better then expected for the price. Its plastic build but feels sturdy.
Ryzen 5500 is very good processor for this price (51K) and display is gorgeous. I bought this Laptop for these two reasons. Battery performance is above average typical 4-5 hours which is more than enough at this price."

Look quite good but black color is osm ✨"
146,4,"Tbh, this was my first laptop. I really don't know how to start this but this laptop is pretty good. I mean all i did w this laptop until now is just general usage and its satisfactory. Display is also good but its not clear when the video is in low quality. Battery is okayish, could've been better. In the end, I'm happy w it and that's what matters for me."
147,5,"It is very fantastic, I found this stuff so amazing
And I also liked it very much, only there is a slight lack or lower in the sound as compared with HP pavilion or Dell Inspiron,, but overall it was right and good .
Try to buy it's overall performance is nice 👍👍"
148,4,Best laptop with all specifications. I bought rosy gold because of silver color stock not available at that time. The lap I bought for 51k with icici credit bank in freedom sale. They should provide protection or shiled on camera to avoid dust into it. This OLEd display is mesmerizing and the sound was extraordinary. But u have to buy additional internal hdd for more storage. No heating problem. It is very topnotch to buy
149,5,"I have just bought this laptop, now I am loving this product. Super performance, wonderful display, battery is also good. Booting time taken is very fast. I think it is really worthy."

You can't see screen properly at a small angle from screen. Redmi phones are famous for good Quality screens but what did redmi do in laptop screen is hard to understand. I would not recommend this due to screen quality. Go for a good quality LED screen laptop.

288,3,"Flipkart's delivery service is worst ( i got my laptop in 10 days)
Performance is top notch.
Display is average don't expect something great
The vent blowing on the display concerns me.
Battery is below average lasts 2 to 2.5 hr on battery saver mode.
No sd card slot is a con.
Thunderbolt4 is great
Fingerprint sensor is smaller than usual
Build quality is awesome ( fingerprint marks coming on the top lid as well as trackpad)
Thermals are good.
Would post the gaming review after some time."
289,4,"Purchased it on Flipkart, been using for last 1 week. Working good so far. Will share a detailed review in coming weeks. Only thing I'm concerned about right now is it's exhaust facing the screen. So i believe in case of heavy usage it's gonna throw hot air on screen which is not gonna be good thing"
290,4,"Bought it two days ago. Was a quick delivery from Flipkart's side.
Looking at the performance, I see the RAM management isn't something that's really great. Looks like it could be a bit more better.
The exhaust placed near the hinge is giving me some doubts on how long my display might last if the heat dissipation is too much and often.
Apart from that, I think the laptop is good in terms of boot speed, and build quality. Though, I feel a bit more could be improved on the build side.

Pros:

1. Laptop is super fast as of now. Takes a few second to boot up.
2. The fingerprint sensor works quite well.
3. Games seem to run pretty smoothly so far.
4. The design is quite sleek.

Cons:

1. Speaker volume is quite low. You might have to invest in a good speaker/headphone if you wanna enjoy your movies/sports matches to the full.

If you go with thin and light type, it can only be useful in normal uses and not for high end gaming but has great battery like 6+ hrs.

I got this for 54k (8gb variant) and for the price, this is really a steal.
In my real world usage, I found that the battery and screen is excellent. You cannot expect more in this price. With continuous browsing and streaming, you will get more than 5 hours of battery.

2) 1660 gfx card under this price segment is a bang for buck. I had no problems playing AAA games with maxed graphics at 50+ fps. Older games like GTA 5, CSGO etc are smoother than ever. Even Minecraft with heavy texture packs runs smoothly.

It's literally a oven where the cpu temps goes 97-99 in cyberpunk lowest settings. To manage it lower the tgp of cpu that doesn't cause you much fps drop (only 5-7fps drop) and run it in manual mode or silent mode.

Initial impressions

1. Very slim and light relative to other in this segment.

316,5,Laptop provides good performance as expected from i5 12450h processor and rtx 3050 but might observe high cpu temperatures (above 90) in gaming or cpu intensive tasks. 8 gb ram is good but you have to upgrade it to 16 gb in future. Display is ok and some might don't like single colour keyboard. The product is great and build quality is also top notch.

The HP laptop is a great computer for anyone who wants a durable and reliable machine. It has a long battery life and is very fast. Coding purpose is good .The Ryzen 5 5500U is a capable processor for general use, but it's not going to be a speed demon. It'll handle basic tasks and some light gaming without issue, but you're not going to be able to push it too hard. If you're looking for a processor that can handle a bit more, you'll want to look elsewhere."

411,3,"Flipkart's delivery service is worst ( i got my laptop in 10 days)
Performance is top notch.
Display is average don't expect something great
The vent blowing on the display concerns me.
Battery is below average lasts 2 to 2.5 hr on battery saver mode.
No sd card slot is a con.
Thunderbolt4 is great
Fingerprint sensor is smaller than usual
Build quality is awesome ( fingerprint marks coming on the top lid as well as trackpad)
Thermals are good.
Would post the gaming review after some time."
412,4,"Purchased it on Flipkart, been using for last 1 week. Working good so far. Will share a detailed review in coming weeks. Only thing I'm concerned about right now is it's exhaust facing the screen. So i believe in case of heavy usage it's gonna throw hot air on screen which is not gonna be good thing"
413,4,"Bought it two days ago. Was a quick delivery from Flipkart's side.
Looking at the performance, I see the RAM management isn't something that's really great. Looks like it could be a bit more better.
The exhaust placed near the hinge is giving me some doubts on how long my display might last if the heat dissipation is too much and often.
Apart from that, I think the laptop is good in terms of boot speed, and build quality. Though, I feel a bit more could be improved on the build side.

420,4,I got this Laptop at 57K excluding the 5% cash back for flipkart axis credit card. Considering the prise and the Spec we can say it is value for money to some extent. One thing that I didn't liked about this laptop is its display. It is one of the cheapest displays which we will see in below 30k laptops. It doesn't not feel like a IPS panel. So if entertainment is one of ur priorities then definitely u will regret. display is manageable for day today work and computation intensive activities....

562,5,"Great product and very good laptop for students pursuing Computer Engineering. It has got very good keryboard in this price range. And, due to ryzen 5 5th generation processor it is performing very well and the only con which i got is that 8gb ram is on the lower side. In order to play games and to enjoy the games to the fullest i recommend you to add another 8gb ram stick. Other than that it is very great machine for coders and you can do coding and all coding related stuff very gracefully."
563,5,"Everything is a pro, just want to mention two things
Battery backup will be around 2+ hrs so if you carry this laptop somewhere where charging is not available, you should be careful. Second brightness is a place where lenovo has cut the costs. Thats all, apart from these performance is beast, cooling is also good. I do gaming and work mostly. Works good for me."

Cons-
Webcam is grainy (no update has been able to fix it)- Not a major concern but for the price you pay it is indeed expected.
Color- I opted for Gold (after seeing all the images online), however it has a rose tint and looks pinkish in indoor lights. Its not gold-gold, its pinkish-gold.

The laptop is so much slik looking and classy. It is so much premium looking. The display is great and the performance is even faster.

Boot time is less than 6 second."

698,5,This is a great device as a personal laptop or work machine. The Full HD camera is a welcome addition. 6 month M365 subscription is free with this machine and that is a good add-on benefit.

trackpad is best in this price segment and Backlight is good and practical.

Superb display. to protect your oled display, hide task bar and change walpaper frequently, if listening songs then put a dynamic screen. Anything static on screen with more screen time can cause burn issue.

803,3,"Good laptop for everyday use. Nothing special about it, except the performance. The 12th Gen Core i3 1220P is a better deal compared to 1215U at this price. But, the extra performance comes at the cost of battery life -- the laptop works for just 3 hours on battery power. Its screen is another disappointment -- bad viewing angles, disappointing colour coverage, and blown out dynamic range. Overall build quality is modest with plastic coverage mostly."

Better to go for this processor instead of lower performing i3-1215U(2P + 4E cores). Performance wise this laptop is very good. Boot time is almost negligible. Hardly takes couple of seconds. Battery life is decent, if not best. Display is pretty brig..."

1108,5,"I just got it for 82k and this is best value for money laptop.
It is one of the best gaming laptop.
It's performance and design can't be described in words.
If u want a laptop under 90k then blindly go for it."

2) sometimes control button does not click."
1112,5,the perfect one!
1113,5,Super 😎❤️
1114,4,"the design is awesome, definitely looks like a hard ore gaming laptop,

expected its performance to be better than my earlier laptop which had ryzen 5 - 3rd gen processor, but so far ryzen 7 - 6th gen processor power is not yet visible, some issues in memory management was visible, which might be due to windows 11

it was not having nvidia drivers pre installed"
1115,5,Beast... No other words ...
1116,4,"Performance wise it's quite good 12th Generation Processor performs very fast.

I didn't like the display much it's very average however since I use my laptop with additional monitor so not a big concern for me.

It's sleek in design and lighter weight could have been better if provided with Keyboard backlit.

Not happy with its camera poor resolution.

Overall- I would performance wise it's a quite good laptop but don't expect a nice good display or camera."

1134,5,"Great product, no such feature found that can stop you to buy it except it’s price.

It’s costly for Indian market but performance wise wowed.

Battery life is also great lasts 17 hours what apple claims.

In first 4-6 hours it seems that it’s not using its battery, remains 99-100%"
1135,5,Excellent product. Definitely lives up to the hype and can handle any task thrown at it with ease. The battery lasts ages and it isn't plagued with any of the issues prevalent in the previous generation macs with x86 processor architecture.

No heat generation on general usage.
Provided military grade so it's making too good in build quality. But design is poor and sound quality is less when compared to other models in asus tuf. Ryzen 5 processor is awesome and display is 17 inches and the weight is 3 kg(approximately). Best to buy a large volume backpack for this laptop."

And the RGB give a heart to the laptop
Much thanks to Asus for such a good laptop in mid range"
1141,5,"A very good laptop overall for regular use. The design and build quality are top notch. As always, Asus has made an excellent machine keeping users in mind. The laptop reminds of the old days when laptops used to be bulky and included LED indicators for things like power and caps lock. The multiple indicators are really helpful. Especially, the red indicators on power button and caps lock look cool. The power button shape also gives it a great look. The keyboard is as close to a classic keybo..."
1142,4,"Definitely the best if your budget is under 55k. I got it for 52k during the Big Billion day Sale. I thought of going for HP pavilion with Ryzen 5 5600 which is better processor compared to Ryzen 5 4600. But the Hp Pavilion design and keyboard colour looks dull and unattractive. I am very satisfied with this laptop.

Although the 4800H is not as good in single core performance compared to I7 10th gen, multi-core performance is much better,multitasking, gaming,and heavy processing software are a breeze to work with the 144 refresh rate is awesome.

So you surely need to add another 8 at least. Good thing it's easy to upgrade.

Its too big to lug around especially if you travel, not something that's super light.
The screen of course is not an OLED, so color gamut is bit low. OLED screens get to be more expensive.

Other reason that MSI is best over other laptops is

.Best build quality
.smooth performance

1167,5,Display performance is awesome with 144 mhz refresh rated. Its the best gaming laptop for this price range. No other laptop can match the specs while maintaining a good price like this one does. Its worth of money. It has a top tier GPU with ray tracing tech and 16 GB of RAM along with a RTX 3050 Ti 4Gb graphic cards give you best gaming experience. Laptop cooling system is working perfectly. This combination has yet to be matched at this price range and hence provides the best performance.

The Laptop is Great considering its specs. NVIDIA 3060, i7 Gen-12 is a real beast in the budget.
Display size is huge YES. But the quality is not Great maybe thats where the budget was adjusterd by ASUS, dont expect great picture quality.
Its dual-fans will become F16 once you are gaming or heavy tasking.
First day battery backup was 6 hours, 2nd day 4 hours and as of now its going between 2-3hours for Non-Gaming and simple browsing."
1239,5,I like the ms office 2021 and speed of the cpu as well as the display size is huge than any other laptop that is big advantage and i hate that the device is less hours in charging and display is not that much accurate in colors and this laptop is not having any fingerprint or face lock features that is big drawback apart from that it will be the most affordable gaming laptop in this segment ..

1246,4,Battery is not as expected. In the product page it say 12 hrs battery backup but in real it only stays for 4-5 hrs as a new laptop. When you use the dual screen option the secondary monitor quality become very low. Performance & design is great.
1247,5,Worth it.. goor performance..
1248,5,"Definitely worth the purchase if you are looking for more processing power. If you are a gamer, then I'd suggest going for a 16gb variant or buying this and upgrading the rams.

I have been using this for 2 weeks now on a daily 10hrs basis. This thing is best in handling multiple stuff smoothly (mostly because of i7). No issues in performance or hardware so far. The refresh rate and everything else feels smooth while handling it."

1258,4,"Updated Review
It's literally a oven where the cpu temps goes 97-99 in cyberpunk lowest settings. To manage it lower the tgp of cpu that doesn't cause you much fps drop (only 5-7fps drop) and run it in manual mode or silent mode.

Initial impressions

1. Very slim and light relative to other in this segment.

1259,5,Incredibly good for handling high end games. Graphics quality is good and fan speed is quite. Found a minor glich in track pad. Display colors are good. Slim and powerfull laptop. Battery life is good.
1260,5,Laptop provides good performance as expected from i5 12450h processor and rtx 3050 but might observe high cpu temperatures (above 90) in gaming or cpu intensive tasks. 8 gb ram is good but you have to upgrade it to 16 gb in future. Display is ok and some might don't like single colour keyboard. The product is great and build quality is also top notch.
1261,5,Battery is good . Performance is top notch 💪 build is good . overall laptop is worth it
1262,3,"Definitely not value for money , laptop is good in all areas!
Display is okok
Built is super no flex
Battery pretty good
Avg cpu temp 60 heats up to 90 in gaming"
1263,5,Incredible laptop 🙀
1264,5,Best laptop in range of price..
1265,5,"So far everything looks okay, and the build quality is really good, so far I've not had any heating issues, the overall display is good you wouldn't notice the colour defects, but you would notice the backlight bleed when booting.

Overall everything looks okay for now, I will write my full review in a month"
1266,4,"Display can be better.
Camera is very bad.
Performance and design is excellent."
1267,4,"best leptop at this price range
good point- Built Quality, Performance, keyboard and everything.
negetive point acc. to me- cpu temp goes up to 95' C and GPU Goes of to 82' C in gaming you can called it heater but i think every gaming leptop have same issue.
Tested GTA 5 and Tomb Rider all Part At high Settings."
1268,5,"This laptop is really amazing 😍

Design looks awesome,slim, lightweight and you can go whenever you want because it doesn't look like a gaming laptop
I bought this laptop in sale at 86990 and this is literally, value for money for me



I can really recommend you to buy this"
1269,5,"I got this product somewhere around 88k and at that price point its an absoulte steal, my primary usage is software development and gaming and i am very much happy it does great at both , gaming wise buy it if you have never bought any gaming laptop you wont be disappointed it usually runs all the games at high or mix high and mid setting at 1080p with no issues. Battery is decent it will last at max 2 3 hrs at heavy usage and 3+ if just causual surfing and stuff , you could turn on silent pr..."

Good quality
Nice design

Packing condition is good and safer"
1271,5,This Product is Awsome. But Battery is not Very good.this is avarage. But Laptop Other Parts is Fabulous. I bought this Laptop for Rs. 87k something. You can also buy it.
1272,5,"Amazing experience!
my first gaming laptop but disappointed with battery drain and no RGB keyboard best deal for this configuration"
1273,3,"Perfect for office use.
Not good for gaming. heats up like an oven, even at low settings."
1274,5,Just Go for It
1275,5,Delivery well and it's nice to see the laptop awesome
1276,4,The fan sound is too irritating sometimes. I might be feeling so as it's my first gaming laptop.
1277,5,Great
1278,5,"Excellent delivery, Flipkart has taken good care of its status of the delivery through its customer support assistance throughout the process. The product is delivered within 4-5 days without any delay. About the MacBook, it's Magic. The package was up to Mark and the device is excellent so far. This M1 based Macbook has a reputation that needs no further introduction and is up to its mark. The silver colour Macbook has the classy old shiny look that I have no regrets about buying over space..."
1279,5,"Best in class no technology can match Apple btw . Highly satisfied and happy after getting this beast .
Matches the speed of a human . I’ll recommend 8gb over 16gb cuz I can’t see much difference at this primary stage if using for 1 week . Best genuine delivery I trust flipkart from now."
1280,5,"Loved it, already using same product for 4 months.
This is second one I ordered. But on xcode sometime required some additional steps for setting up react native projects. But now community support for M1 support is widely available so I haven't faced any blocking issue till now. Performance is drastically improved compare to earlier MacBook Air with Intel chipset."
1281,5,if you like apple don't think its worth to buy and very satisfying...feels so premium and super fast
1282,5,"M1 chip works like a charm.
If you are a programmer, then buy the 16 gigs version.
Audio is like very rich..."
1283,5,"Best laptop, compact one, awesome delivery by Flipkart, was tensed about the product, but received in sealed and perfect condition, was better if I purchase during big billion days, paid few buck extra"
1284,5,"Great product. Great Configuration. No laptop comes close to the value-for-money proposition of Air M1. Reliability and long life sets it apart. I bought it in exchange of my 9 year old Macbook Pro. It was still in a great working condition with 5-6 hours of battery life per charge. Which Windows or Linux machine can claim such a long life?
Overall, a great purchase. Great offers by Flipkart."
1285,5,Great !!
1286,5,"Mind blown purchase.
I got this one for 99900 and for that price it is a steal deal. M1 is miles away from latest generation of I5s and I7s.

Pros
Battery : Battery backup is phenomenal, I get around 14 hours of battery life on this."
1287,5,"Outstanding laptop at this price point, & great battery life as well."
1288,5,"Even though it has a 85w 3070 its still powerful, runs AAA games with rtx on 70+fps(1080p). Display is really good with 100%srgb so colors are accurate. Cpu is really powerful as well run valorant at200+fps on max settings (2k display). Worth it"
1289,5,"with just 85w power, for RTX 3070, it's a bit inadequate power, but still powerful enough, can runs AAA games. Display is really good with 100% srgb, so colors are accurate, with 165Hz., a good one... CPU is powerful, 16GB Ram DDR4... can say an Just Enough Laptop overall., one can say... apart from Battery Life, 4-5 hr daily use. but worth it at the price. A clear thumps up!!"
1290,5,Overall it's an amazing laptop with cheap price I purchased it in rakshabandhan discount it cost me around 99000 so I am happy with this you won't get a laptop with rtx 3070 this cheap and the only thing that's not good is it only supports till 85 w but still it gives amazing performance loved it
1291,5,"Received the laptop in perfect condition.

Started playing Cyberpunk 2077. The game runs so smoothly. I am really amazed by the performance. The laptop heats up pretty quickly. But that is expected I guess. Overall performance is great. Will review again in 3 months."
1292,5,One of the most powerful laptop in the price beast
1293,4,Though it has rtx gpu but it's locked at 85 watt TDP so performance hit is there. I am playing Dying Light 2 with it and barely getting 50 fps sometimes as low as 35 fps.otherwise everything is fine
1294,4,Awesome product and performance
1295,5,Works great
1296,5,It is good as in given info.
1297,5,"Absolutely Fantastic, You Must Go For It Without A Thought. There's No Cons As Such, Just It Gets Heated After Heavy Usage So You Need To Get An Additional Cooling Pad For It."
1298,5,"This is my 3rd Dell laptop. Bought it on big billion days sale. Was worried as there were no reviews, but this turned out to be great.

Cons :

1306,5,"What a value for money !
I got it for 75,000 !! ( RTX3050ti ) 🔥🔥 with 16 gb ram

The packaging was great, and it was all protected inside.

The only thing that i dont like is the output of its power on battery. For example: when i play FORZA HORIZON 5 with charger connected, it gives me 120 fps. But when i play it on battery it gives me 35 fps max and that too with lag.

Soo ya ... i have to go everywhere with my charger
But no complaints! I'll still recommend you to buy it without any..."
1307,5,"In one line: It destroyers all laptop in it's price range.

Build Quality: Build quality is amazing, it's light, solid and sleek.

Battery: Just with normal video playback and web browser, I'm getting 4-5 hours of backup. So no problem with backup.

Only issue is there is no extra slot for adding 2nd storage drive. But you can use external drives, there are lot of ports.
Rest everything is awesome."
1311,1,"Issues with this laptop

Bad quality webcam
Bad quality microphone
Screen wobbling while typing.
Pathetic sound quality.

Other things are as per specs.

Note ~ no exchange or return provided by flipkart in this situation, the brand MSI and the seller have denied to take any action about the quality, So, I am stuck with this laptop until I plan to buy a new one someday. So be careful before buying such products from flipkart."
1312,5,It's a beast. Go for it if your budget is under 80k...
1313,5,Really a good laptop at this price

Best for gaming 🎮
Great design . Loved the design of the whole laptop. For me it is 4.5 star"
1315,5,Simply awesome
1316,4,"Pro's : This is just a beast and performs without any lag. I was in dilemma to purchase this and completely satisfied with the laptop.

Cons: If you're looking for a good battery back up definitely this machine won't be a suitable choice. For normal work itself not lasting 2 hrs. Max 1.30 mins for normal usage. For gaming definitely we should plug in charger always."
1317,5,overall it has a best performance if you are looking in this price range. This is my favourite brand by the way and they give you a best gaming performance and the cooling system is way better than other laptops in this price range.
