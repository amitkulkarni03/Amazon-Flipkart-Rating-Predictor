    I bought this and after several days it started heating so much and the cursor usually get freeze.... Camera quality was good at first day but within few days it got worst..... Samsung's SSD is too fast so the laptop get start within 2-3 sec...I3 is quite decent... If there would be a fingerprint sensor then it would be great but there isn't......overall it's good to buy if ur budget is 40k......

    Works well, and no issues. Got the warranty registered with Lenovo to match the purchase date. The laptop speed is fast. Battery backup is fine. So far no signs of over-heating.  The screen resolution is good. The initial default setting of brightness was too high, however a darker theme is easier on the eyes.  Overallreading comfort is good.  Windows 11 and lifetime MS office apps are good/as expected.  This is a good laptop for students, home use activities, DIY, etc...  The MacAfee LiveSafe offer popup of rs 199 was good for a years protection. The Two year default lenovo warrant is as advertised.  The Sound is loud from the speakers. Keyboard quality if good.  Upgradability from 8GM to 12GB/DIMM max is good to have for future. The 512GB SSD is fast. Can be upgraded to a TB in future.  Overall quality is good, nothing to complain about. Did not need any installation support.

    If you are looking for a decent laptop and resonably priced this is the one. I liked the laptop and carries out my normal daily task with ease. Booting is quite fast and infact automatic boot once you lift the upper panel. Quite fast and snappy no lags with good audio quality. The only  complain is all the ports are on the left hand side of the laptop that makes it inconvenient. Also one more missing element is type c port. Overall a decent product.

    The laptop is excellent with respect to performance and processor speed. It boots in less than a minute. And battery lasts almost six hours.The only downside is its TN display. If you are very specific about colours, choose a laptop with IPS display which are a bit expensive. If your focus is on budget, go for this laptop with TN display.

    Beautiful machine. Quiet, fast, fantastic screen, good keyboard,light weight and looks elegant. The only problem I had was the Touchpad response. The scroll response on two fingers was like you have put a handbrake in car and driving, to much inertia and slow. I fixed it with a registary hack, but chat with lenovo support drew a blank. Had to do it myself after seaching the net. Unless you are familiar with regedit please do not try it , ask someone who knows. For me it worked changing the Hexa value from 32 (default) to 12 in Computer \Hkey_Current _User\Software \Microsoft\Wisp\Touch\After that the scrolling two finger works like a charm. Cannot blame Lenovo though as I did not see anything in windows 11 settings for Touchpad to increase scroll speed. Pointer yes but not scroll 2 finger.Wish Lenovo does it in its driver support. I took off one star because of that. Otherwise a wonderful machine, coming from an 6 year old laptop , this machine rocks. Not a gamer so cannot comment on that.

    Have been using this for 2 weeks now, below is my experience:Pros:+ excellent display, 2.8k OLED panel is awesome, vivid colors, very good contrast ratio, love watching videos on this device it has excellent viewing angles+ lightweight at 1.3 kg+ lightning fast with 16gb ram (I got this laptop specifically because it had 42xx MHz Freq ram. Other laptops have lower Freq ram ~3600 MHz)+ super fast charging, with a very small form factor+ Large trackpad and gesture support is good+ Battery life is average - I'm getting around 6-8 hours with moderate use, expected around 10 hours from this device+ Does not come with too much bloatCons- downfiring speakers which are just ok - you will need to connect to external speakers/ headsets for better experience- no backpack provided- only 1 usb port- does not run Linux well ( observed that xorg based distros work well, so this definitely looks like a problem with Wayland and not a distro/kernel issue) should be fixed with future updates.- there's no clarity on warranty registration date - default start date shows date of shipping which needs to be manually changed from Lenovo vantage app and takes 1-2 days - but this is not communicated to the user and is to be discovered on your own - a very poor experience as you could lose 3-6 months of warranty because of lack of awareness

    I really appreciate Appario Retail Gurgaon,Amazon India and Lenovo India to brought such a good performance and value for money LAPTOP PC.The deal available on Amazon India on 06/08/2022 were amesome and I purchased this laptop at effective price of Rs53286(Rs14000 under old laptop exchange offer by exchanging my old HP Core I3 7th Generation with windows 10 Laptop and 5% Cashback on balance Rs56090.I had searched almost 100 Laptops on Amazon,Offline Store and Flipkart before purchasing this Laptop but i thought this is the best deal i got.Since prices of electronics items varies time to time hence may be possible that you get this Laptop PC even smaller value than me during any sale.But the prices of this Laptop is presently enhanced by Rs3000 as i checked as on 01.09.2022 compare to this Price was as on 06.08.2022 till 16.08.2022.Specifications given in product details page are correct.Also Battery backup is little bit smaller and charging time on little bit on higher side as compared in product details.But i will check further using different battery settings and different performance mode and update the same in near future with detailed product review.Anyhow good product with three years Lenovo Warranty, maximum by any Laptop manufacturer.PS:For 3 years warranty and MS Office 2021 you may contact to lenovo customer care on WhatsApp and toll free 24√ó7 number.Customer care details you may get in Lenovo Vantage Application came pre-installed with Laptop PC but you should have any good speed internet connection so that Lenovo executive install the MS office 2021 if you didn't get pre-installed.Also i had seen complaint of a customer to get the old laptop from Amazon because lesser warranty. But if you get lesser than 3 years warranty as the same may be checked through Lenovo Vantage App than please contact their customer care with invoice soft copy as proof of purchase and provided to them when they ask.Within 2 to 3 working days warranty at you Lenovo Vantage App updated 3 years from the date of purchase/ordering on Amazon.Also to check genuine product please ensure that package delivered should be properly sealed and Inner Lenovo Box seal should remain intact while delivery.As well as while using Brand new Laptop for first time  you have to connect it to good High speed internet as Windows 11 pre-installed on Laptop will be get activated and system will ask to configure Biometric and Face recognition settings under Windows Hello programme.This is one time exercise. So if you get Old Laptop any how you will never be asked to perform the above procedure.Any how if you make purchase from M/s Appario Retail on Amazon India it is very rare that you may get such type of problem.Thanking you.

    Lightweight laptop as well as a compact usb c charger. Rapid charging and lasts approximately 4 hrs of continuous use, charging takes less than an hour. Excellent build quantity looks a every bit high-end. 2 thunderbolt4 and usb a and 3.5 mm.. that's it. Fast datatransfer with thunderbolt4 is a boon.Lenovo base warranty starts the day laptop leaves the factory, so you have to re-register once purchased to restart the warranty date. Seller should include this info in the listing.Excellent laptop go for it.

    This is light and fast laptop.Did not face any issue till now.Comes with three year warranty but not sure how support will be in case of issue.Only draw back is that it comes with single usba port and thurbolt port.You need port expander for connecting other peripherals like monitor, keyboard.Does not have hdmi port too.

Samsung's SSD is too fast so the laptop get start within 2-3 sec...I3 is quite decent... If there would be a fingerprint sensor then it would be great but there isn't......overall it's good to buy if ur budget is 40k......

    Works well, and no issues. Got the warranty registered with Lenovo to match the purchase date. The laptop speed is fast. Battery backup is fine. So far no signs of over-heating.  The screen resolution is good. The initial default setting of brightness was too high, however a darker theme is easier on the eyes.  Overallreading comfort is good.  Windows 11 and lifetime MS office apps are good/as expected.  This is a good laptop for students, home use activities, DIY, etc...  The MacAfee LiveSafe offer popup of rs 199 was good for a years protection. The Two year default lenovo warrant is as advertised.  The Sound is loud from the speakers. Keyboard quality if good.  Upgradability from 8GM to 12GB/DIMM max is good to have for future. The 512GB SSD is fast. Can be upgraded to a TB in future.  Overall quality is good, nothing to complain about. Did not need any installation support.

    If you are looking for a decent laptop and resonably priced this is the one. I liked the laptop and carries out my normal daily task with ease. Booting is quite fast and infact automatic boot once you lift the upper panel. Quite fast and snappy no lags with good audio quality. The only  complain is all the ports are on the left hand side of the laptop that makes it inconvenient. Also one more missing element is type c port. Overall a decent product.

    The laptop is excellent with respect to performance and processor speed. It boots in less than a minute. And battery lasts almost six hours.The only downside is its TN display. If you are very specific about colours, choose a laptop with IPS display which are a bit expensive. If your focus is on budget, go for this laptop with TN display.

    Beautiful machine. Quiet, fast, fantastic screen, good keyboard,light weight and looks elegant. The only problem I had was the Touchpad response. The scroll response on two fingers was like you have put a handbrake in car and driving, to much inertia and slow. I fixed it with a registary hack, but chat with lenovo support drew a blank. Had to do it myself after seaching the net. Unless you are familiar with regedit please do not try it , ask someone who knows. For me it worked changing the Hexa value from 32 (default) to 12 in Computer \Hkey_Current _User\Software \Microsoft\Wisp\Touch\After that the scrolling two finger works like a charm. Cannot blame Lenovo though as I did not see anything in windows 11 settings for Touchpad to increase scroll speed. Pointer yes but not scroll 2 finger.Wish Lenovo does it in its driver support. I took off one star because of that. Otherwise a wonderful machine, coming from an 6 year old laptop , this machine rocks. Not a gamer so cannot comment on that.

    Have been using this for 2 weeks now, below is my experience:Pros:+ excellent display, 2.8k OLED panel is awesome, vivid colors, very good contrast ratio, love watching videos on this device it has excellent viewing angles+ lightweight at 1.3 kg+ lightning fast with 16gb ram (I got this laptop specifically because it had 42xx MHz Freq ram. Other laptops have lower Freq ram ~3600 MHz)+ super fast charging, with a very small form factor+ Large trackpad and gesture support is good+ Battery life is average - I'm getting around 6-8 hours with moderate use, expected around 10 hours from this device+ Does not come with too much bloatCons- downfiring speakers which are just ok - you will need to connect to external speakers/ headsets for better experience- no backpack provided- only 1 usb port- does not run Linux well ( observed that xorg based distros work well, so this definitely looks like a problem with Wayland and not a distro/kernel issue) should be fixed with future updates.- there's no clarity on warranty registration date - default start date shows date of shipping which needs to be manually changed from Lenovo vantage app and takes 1-2 days - but this is not communicated to the user and is to be discovered on your own - a very poor experience as you could lose 3-6 months of warranty because of lack of awareness

    I really appreciate Appario Retail Gurgaon,Amazon India and Lenovo India to brought such a good performance and value for money LAPTOP PC.The deal available on Amazon India on 06/08/2022 were amesome and I purchased this laptop at effective price of Rs53286(Rs14000 under old laptop exchange offer by exchanging my old HP Core I3 7th Generation with windows 10 Laptop and 5% Cashback on balance Rs56090.I had searched almost 100 Laptops on Amazon,Offline Store and Flipkart before purchasing this Laptop but i thought this is the best deal i got.Since prices of electronics items varies time to time hence may be possible that you get this Laptop PC even smaller value than me during any sale.But the prices of this Laptop is presently enhanced by Rs3000 as i checked as on 01.09.2022 compare to this Price was as on 06.08.2022 till 16.08.2022.Specifications given in product details page are correct.Also Battery backup is little bit smaller and charging time on little bit on higher side as compared in product details.But i will check further using different battery settings and different performance mode and update the same in near future with detailed product review.Anyhow good product with three years Lenovo Warranty, maximum by any Laptop manufacturer.PS:For 3 years warranty and MS Office 2021 you may contact to lenovo customer care on WhatsApp and toll free 24√ó7 number.Customer care details you may get in Lenovo Vantage Application came pre-installed with Laptop PC but you should have any good speed internet connection so that Lenovo executive install the MS office 2021 if you didn't get pre-installed.Also i had seen complaint of a customer to get the old laptop from Amazon because lesser warranty. But if you get lesser than 3 years warranty as the same may be checked through Lenovo Vantage App than please contact their customer care with invoice soft copy as proof of purchase and provided to them when they ask.Within 2 to 3 working days warranty at you Lenovo Vantage App updated 3 years from the date of purchase/ordering on Amazon.Also to check genuine product please ensure that package delivered should be properly sealed and Inner Lenovo Box seal should remain intact while delivery.As well as while using Brand new Laptop for first time  you have to connect it to good High speed internet as Windows 11 pre-installed on Laptop will be get activated and system will ask to configure Biometric and Face recognition settings under Windows Hello programme.This is one time exercise. So if you get Old Laptop any how you will never be asked to perform the above procedure.Any how if you make purchase from M/s Appario Retail on Amazon India it is very rare that you may get such type of problem.Thanking you.

    Lightweight laptop as well as a compact usb c charger. Rapid charging and lasts approximately 4 hrs of continuous use, charging takes less than an hour. Excellent build quantity looks a every bit high-end. 2 thunderbolt4 and usb a and 3.5 mm.. that's it. Fast datatransfer with thunderbolt4 is a boon.Lenovo base warranty starts the day laptop leaves the factory, so you have to re-register once purchased to restart the warranty date. Seller should include this info in the listing.Excellent laptop go for it.

    Works well, and no issues. Got the warranty registered with Lenovo to match the purchase date. The laptop speed is fast. Battery backup is fine. So far no signs of over-heating.  The screen resolution is good. The initial default setting of brightness was too high, however a darker theme is easier on the eyes.  Overallreading comfort is good.  Windows 11 and lifetime MS office apps are good/as expected.  This is a good laptop for students, home use activities, DIY, etc...  The MacAfee LiveSafe offer popup of rs 199 was good for a years protection. The Two year default lenovo warrant is as advertised.  The Sound is loud from the speakers. Keyboard quality if good.  Upgradability from 8GM to 12GB/DIMM max is good to have for future. The 512GB SSD is fast. Can be upgraded to a TB in future.  Overall quality is good, nothing to complain about.

    If you are looking for a decent laptop and resonably priced this is the one. I liked the laptop and carries out my normal daily task with ease.

The only  complain is all the ports are on the left hand side of the laptop that makes it inconvenient. Also one more missing element is type c port. Overall a decent product.

    The laptop is excellent with respect to performance and processor speed. It boots in less than a minute. And battery lasts almost six hours.The only downside is its TN display. If you are very specific about colours, choose a laptop with IPS display which are a bit expensive. If your focus is on budget, go for this laptop with TN display.

The only  complain is all the ports are on the left hand side of the laptop that makes it inconvenient. Also one more missing element is type c port. Overall a decent product.

    The laptop is excellent with respect to performance and processor speed. It boots in less than a minute. And battery lasts almost six hours.The only downside is its TN display. If you are very specific about colours, choose a laptop with IPS display which are a bit expensive. If your focus is on budget, go for this laptop with TN display.

    Beautiful machine. Quiet, fast, fantastic screen, good keyboard,light weight and looks elegant. The only problem I had was the Touchpad response. The scroll response on two fingers was like you have put a handbrake in car and driving, to much inertia and slow. I fixed it with a registary hack, but chat with lenovo support drew a blank. Had to do it myself after seaching the net. Unless you are familiar with regedit please do not try it , ask someone who knows. For me it worked changing the Hexa value from 32 (default) to 12 in Computer \Hkey_Current _User\Software \Microsoft\Wisp\Touch\After that the scrolling two finger works like a charm. Cannot blame Lenovo though as I did not see anything in windows 11 settings for Touchpad to increase scroll speed. Pointer yes but not scroll 2 finger.Wish Lenovo does it in its driver support. I took off one star because of that. Otherwise a wonderful machine, coming from an 6 year old laptop , this machine rocks. Not a gamer so cannot comment on that.

    Have been using this for 2 weeks now, below is my experience:Pros:+ excellent display, 2.8k OLED panel is awesome, vivid colors, very good contrast ratio, love watching videos on this device it has excellent viewing angles+ lightweight at 1.3 kg+ lightning fast with 16gb ram (I got this laptop specifically because it had 42xx MHz Freq ram. Other laptops have lower Freq ram ~3600 MHz)+ super fast charging, with a very small form factor+ Large trackpad and gesture support is good+ Battery life is average - I'm getting around 6-8 hours with moderate use, expected around 10 hours from this device+ Does not come with too much bloatCons- downfiring speakers which are just ok - you will need to connect to external speakers/ headsets for better experience- no backpack provided- only 1 usb port- does not run Linux well ( observed that xorg based distros work well, so this definitely looks like a problem with Wayland and not a distro/kernel issue) should be fixed with future updates.- there's no clarity on warranty registration date - default start date shows date of shipping which needs to be manually changed from Lenovo vantage app and takes 1-2 days - but this is not communicated to the user and is to be discovered on your own - a very poor experience as you could lose 3-6 months of warranty because of lack of awareness

    I really appreciate Appario Retail Gurgaon,Amazon India and Lenovo India to brought such a good performance and value for money LAPTOP PC.The deal available on Amazon India on 06/08/2022 were amesome and I purchased this laptop at effective price of Rs53286(Rs14000 under old laptop exchange offer by exchanging my old HP Core I3 7th Generation with windows 10 Laptop and 5% Cashback on balance Rs56090.I had searched almost 100 Laptops on Amazon,Offline Store and Flipkart before purchasing this Laptop but i thought this is the best deal i got.Since prices of electronics items varies time to time hence may be possible that you get this Laptop PC even smaller value than me during any sale.But the prices of this Laptop is presently enhanced by Rs3000 as i checked as on 01.09.2022 compare to this Price was as on 06.08.2022 till 16.08.2022.Specifications given in product details page are correct.Also Battery backup is little bit smaller and charging time on little bit on higher side as compared in product details.But i will check further using different battery settings and different performance mode and update the same in near future with detailed product review.Anyhow good product with three years Lenovo Warranty, maximum by any Laptop manufacturer.PS:For 3 years warranty and MS Office 2021 you may contact to lenovo customer care on WhatsApp and toll free 24√ó7 number.Customer care details you may get in Lenovo Vantage Application came pre-installed with Laptop PC but you should have any good speed internet connection so that Lenovo executive install the MS office 2021 if you didn't get pre-installed.Also i had seen complaint of a customer to get the old laptop from Amazon because lesser warranty. But if you get lesser than 3 years warranty as the same may be checked through Lenovo Vantage App than please contact their customer care with invoice soft copy as proof of purchase and provided to them when they ask.Within 2 to 3 working days warranty at you Lenovo Vantage App updated 3 years from the date of purchase/ordering on Amazon.Also to check genuine product please ensure that package delivered should be properly sealed and Inner Lenovo Box seal should remain intact while delivery.As well as while using Brand new Laptop for first time  you have to connect it to good High speed internet as Windows 11 pre-installed on Laptop will be get activated and system will ask to configure Biometric and Face recognition settings under Windows Hello programme.This is one time exercise. So if you get Old Laptop any how you will never be asked to perform the above procedure.Any how if you make purchase from M/s Appario Retail on Amazon India it is very rare that you may get such type of problem.Thanking you.

    Lightweight laptop as well as a compact usb c charger. Rapid charging and lasts approximately 4 hrs of continuous use, charging takes less than an hour. Excellent build quantity looks a every bit high-end. 2 thunderbolt4 and usb a and 3.5 mm.. that's it. Fast datatransfer with thunderbolt4 is a boon.Lenovo base warranty starts the day laptop leaves the factory, so you have to re-register once purchased to restart the warranty date. Seller should include this info in the listing.Excellent laptop go for it.

    1. Sound quality of this product quite well. I use the product approx hole day, I can't find any discomfortablity.2. In high bass mode, bass is not super high , which punch your head, But Quality low bass is there which quite enjoyable in bass music.3. Battery is most powerful sigment in this product. It's provided approx hole day battery life by 15 to 20 min of charging.4. In first impression when I unbox the band was not impressive. The box was curl up. Packaging was not so good. After some time of usies , I'm happy of quality of the product. Light weight. Quite compact, overall good product. But unhappy with with it's price was drop RS 100, 2 day after I bought this product.

    Works well enough, considering the price range. It can, in fact, give some of the more pricier ones in the market a run for their money. Plus the standing of Blaupunkt brand does get translated to good build quality and charging cycle.All in all, satisfied so far with the product with about a month's exhaustive usage, and by the looks of it, seems to be built to last a long time.

    BLAUPUNKTüî•üî•üî•üëåüèªüëåüèªüíØBlaupunkt is an old german brand, their products are mostly known for car audio systems üîä but  I never expected this much quality from blaupunk when it comes to a tiny Bluetooth earbuds‚ù§‚Äçüî• The build quality is excellent  and mainly the sound quality is beyond expectations. These earbuds are made of high quality plastic material and these earbuds are truly light weight and the design is like it is made for gamers ‚ù§‚Äçüî•‚ù§‚Äçüî•‚ù§‚Äçüî• with nice cutting edges and the indicator lights they're actually giving a robotic vibeü§ñ also i really likes the bold italic BLAUPUNKT branding all these things made it looks more premium and stunning feel.üî•üëåüèªTalking about the sound quality its is the most important thing for all earbuds and this earbuds are tuned brilliantly, the highs mids and lows are just insane, the highs are crystal clear nothing more nothing less and mids are pretty damn good its gives pretty balanced and decent mid frequency outputs just like the sound coming from it feels natural and the low frequencies are pretty too damn good üî•üî•üî•üî• compared to highs and mids the low frequencies are tuned a bit more which i liked the most, just because im a bass lover. This earbuds comes with 10 mm drivers which is capable of producing deepbass which is extremely dope and punchy, its like boom boom boomüòÜüòÜüòÜ overall it gives an immersive feel while listening. I highly recommend this product to all the bass lovers out there who are looking for a bass earbuds üî•üëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªThis earbud features include gesture controls like single tap to pause/play and double tap to change track (on right ear piece for next and left for previous track) triple tap to increase/ decrease volume (left for down right for up). Tap and hold 3 sec to power OFF  also single tap for attending callsü§ó im using these earbuds about 2 months and i mainly use these for listening music and sometimes playing games like BGMI and im 100% satisfied with my music experience üòçand 96% satisfied with my gaming experience ‚ò∫ there is not much lag in sounds while gaming but i felt a 3%  delay sometimes but thats not a big thing, i brought this mainly for music not for gamingüòÜ also the noise cancellation also incredible, this earbuds also provides a decent call sound clarity ü•∞ what else do you need from a tiny earbuds ü§î Anyways im perfectly ok with this product ü•≥ü§óAn overall ratings from me about this BLAUPUNKT earbuds‚¨áÔ∏èSound quality 9.9/10Call sound 8/10Noise cancellation 9/10Battery backup 8/10Real-time gaming experience 8/10Unlike other earbuds on the market like MI, boat, truke, realme and one plus, this blaupunkt earbuds are extremely a beast in producing high quality sounds with deep and punchy bass.

    Ear phones are good for music with good bass. For call mic sensitivity is average as far as you are in a close room where no external noise is present , but as soon as you go in open the sensitivity is gone for a toss . The error on the opposite side of the call can barely hear what you are talking , so the noise cancellation feature gets 2 stars . The build and style is very good though .

    Ear phones are good for music with good bass. For call mic sensitivity is average as far as you are in a close room where no external noise is present , but as soon as you go in open the sensitivity is gone for a toss . The error on the opposite side of the call can barely hear what you are talking , so the noise cancellation feature gets 2 stars . The build and style is very good though .

    Works well enough, considering the price range. It can, in fact, give some of the more pricier ones in the market a run for their money. Plus the standing of Blaupunkt brand does get translated to good build quality and charging cycle.All in all, satisfied so far with the product with about a month's exhaustive usage, and by the looks of it, seems to be built to last a long time. Will update this review if encounter any problems in the future.

    Great sound quality. It even has a movie mode with surrond sound which was just amazing a gives a great feeling to watch the movies. The build quality of the case is nice it is very durable. It has C port charging which is very very helpful nowadays because i don't have to look for some other cables for charging my earphones I could just use my phone's charger.The noise cancellation is also of nice quality. The transparent case looks very cool and amusing to watch. The quality of the earphones id also pretty good for this price point. It's also very light unlike some other wireless earphones wich just keep dropping out of my ear beacause they are that heavy.Overall I would definitely recommend this product if you are looking for great sound quality and great looking earphones.

    1. Sound quality of this product quite well. I use the product approx hole day, I can't find any discomfortablity.2. In high bass mode, bass is not super high , which punch your head, But Quality low bass is there which quite enjoyable in bass music.3. Battery is most powerful sigment in this product. It's provided approx hole day battery life by 15 to 20 min of charging.4. In first impression when I unbox the band was not impressive. The box was curl up. Packaging was not so good. After some time of usies , I'm happy of quality of the product. Light weight. Quite compact, overall good product. But unhappy with with it's price was drop RS 100, 2 day after I bought this product.

    1. Sound quality of this product quite well. I use the product approx hole day, I can't find any discomfortablity.2. In high bass mode, bass is not super high , which punch your head, But Quality low bass is there which quite enjoyable in bass music.3. Battery is most powerful sigment in this product. It's provided approx hole day battery life by 15 to 20 min of charging.4. In first impression when I unbox the band was not impressive. The box was curl up. Packaging was not so good. After some time of usies , I'm happy of quality of the product. Light weight. Quite compact, overall good product. But unhappy with with it's price was drop RS 100, 2 day after I bought this product.

    This product really worthy the price, it provides you with better sound and bass quality in this range in comparison to other earbuds. It has a nice sound quality with Deep bass and the case with shinny chrome colour gives you a premium look and makes you feel that, yes you have really paid for it. My calling experience was overall average using them. One thing which I will suggest to improve is It's build quality. My earbuds, case lid is bit loose. Other wise it's good to go. I will recomend to purchase this instead of purchasing The ""Bassbuds Duo"".

    Works well enough, considering the price range. It can, in fact, give some of the more pricier ones in the market a run for their money. Plus the standing of Blaupunkt brand does get translated to good build quality and charging cycle.All in all, satisfied so far with the product with about a month's exhaustive usage, and by the looks of it, seems to be built to last a long time. Will update this review if encounter any problems in the future.

    BLAUPUNKTüî•üî•üî•üëåüèªüëåüèªüíØBlaupunkt is an old german brand, their products are mostly known for car audio systems üîä but  I never expected this much quality from blaupunk when it comes to a tiny Bluetooth earbuds‚ù§‚Äçüî• The build quality is excellent  and mainly the sound quality is beyond expectations. These earbuds are made of high quality plastic material and these earbuds are truly light weight and the design is like it is made for gamers ‚ù§‚Äçüî•‚ù§‚Äçüî•‚ù§‚Äçüî• with nice cutting edges and the indicator lights they're actually giving a robotic vibeü§ñ also i really likes the bold italic BLAUPUNKT branding all these things made it looks more premium and stunning feel.üî•üëåüèªTalking about the sound quality its is the most important thing for all earbuds and this earbuds are tuned brilliantly, the highs mids and lows are just insane, the highs are crystal clear nothing more nothing less and mids are pretty damn good its gives pretty balanced and decent mid frequency outputs just like the sound coming from it feels natural and the low frequencies are pretty too damn good üî•üî•üî•üî• compared to highs and mids the low frequencies are tuned a bit more which i liked the most, just because im a bass lover. This earbuds comes with 10 mm drivers which is capable of producing deepbass which is extremely dope and punchy, its like boom boom boomüòÜüòÜüòÜ overall it gives an immersive feel while listening. I highly recommend this product to all the bass lovers out there who are looking for a bass earbuds üî•üëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªThis earbud features include gesture controls like single tap to pause/play and double tap to change track (on right ear piece for next and left for previous track) triple tap to increase/ decrease volume (left for down right for up). Tap and hold 3 sec to power OFF  also single tap for attending callsü§ó im using these earbuds about 2 months and i mainly use these for listening music and sometimes playing games like BGMI and im 100% satisfied with my music experience üòçand 96% satisfied with my gaming experience ‚ò∫ there is not much lag in sounds while gaming but i felt a 3%  delay sometimes but thats not a big thing, i brought this mainly for music not for gamingüòÜ also the noise cancellation also incredible, this earbuds also provides a decent call sound clarity ü•∞ what else do you need from a tiny earbuds ü§î Anyways im perfectly ok with this product ü•≥ü§óAn overall ratings from me about this BLAUPUNKT earbuds‚¨áÔ∏èSound quality 9.9/10Call sound 8/10Noise cancellation 9/10Battery backup 8/10Real-time gaming experience 8/10Unlike other earbuds on the market like MI, boat, truke, realme and one plus, this blaupunkt earbuds are extremely a beast in producing high quality sounds with deep and punchy bass. I bet you'll never get any better earbuds with this much quality within a price range under 1599ü§®üòé

    Ear phones are good for music with good bass. For call mic sensitivity is average as far as you are in a close room where no external noise is present , but as soon as you go in open the sensitivity is gone for a toss . The error on the opposite side of the call can barely hear what you are talking , so the noise cancellation feature gets 2 stars . The build and style is very good though .

Plus the standing of Blaupunkt brand does get translated to good build quality and charging cycle.All in all, satisfied so far with the product with about a month's exhaustive usage, and by the looks of it, seems to be built to last a long time.

    Ear phones are good for music with good bass. For call mic sensitivity is average as far as you are in a close room where no external noise is present , but as soon as you go in open the sensitivity is gone for a toss . The error on the opposite side of the call can barely hear what you are talking , so the noise cancellation feature gets 2 stars . The build and style is very good though .

    1. Sound quality of this product quite well. I use the product approx hole day, I can't find any discomfortablity.2. In high bass mode, bass is not super high , which punch your head, But Quality low bass is there which quite enjoyable in bass music.3. Battery is most powerful sigment in this product. It's provided approx hole day battery life by 15 to 20 min of charging.4. In first impression when I unbox the band was not impressive. The box was curl up. Packaging was not so good. After some time of usies , I'm happy of quality of the product. Light weight. Quite compact, overall good product. But unhappy with with it's price was drop RS 100, 2 day after I bought this product.

    This product really worthy the price, it provides you with better sound and bass quality in this range in comparison to other earbuds. It has a nice sound quality with Deep bass and the case with shinny chrome colour gives you a premium look and makes you feel that, yes you have really paid for it. My calling experience was overall average using them. One thing which I will suggest to improve is It's build quality. My earbuds, case lid is bit loose. Other wise it's good to go. I will recomend to purchase this instead of purchasing The ""Bassbuds Duo"".

    1. Sound quality of this product quite well. I use the product approx hole day, I can't find any discomfortablity.2. In high bass mode, bass is not super high , which punch your head, But Quality low bass is there which quite enjoyable in bass music.3. Battery is most powerful sigment in this product. It's provided approx hole day battery life by 15 to 20 min of charging.4. In first impression when I unbox the band was not impressive. The box was curl up. Packaging was not so good. After some time of usies , I'm happy of quality of the product. Light weight. Quite compact, overall good product. But unhappy with with it's price was drop RS 100, 2 day after I bought this product.

    This product really worthy the price, it provides you with better sound and bass quality in this range in comparison to other earbuds. It has a nice sound quality with Deep bass and the case with shinny chrome colour gives you a premium look and makes you feel that, yes you have really paid for it. My calling experience was overall average using them. One thing which I will suggest to improve is It's build quality. My earbuds, case lid is bit loose. Other wise it's good to go. I will recomend to purchase this instead of purchasing The ""Bassbuds Duo"".

    Works well enough, considering the price range. It can, in fact, give some of the more pricier ones in the market a run for their money. Plus the standing of Blaupunkt brand does get translated to good build quality and charging cycle.All in all, satisfied so far with the product with about a month's exhaustive usage, and by the looks of it, seems to be built to last a long time. Will update this review if encounter any problems in the future.

    Ear phones are good for music with good bass. For call mic sensitivity is average as far as you are in a close room where no external noise is present , but as soon as you go in open the sensitivity is gone for a toss . The error on the opposite side of the call can barely hear what you are talking , so the noise cancellation feature gets 2 stars . The build and style is very good though .

    1. Sound quality of this product quite well. I use the product approx hole day, I can't find any discomfortablity.2. In high bass mode, bass is not super high , which punch your head, But Quality low bass is there which quite enjoyable in bass music.3. Battery is most powerful sigment in this product. It's provided approx hole day battery life by 15 to 20 min of charging.4. In first impression when I unbox the band was not impressive. The box was curl up. Packaging was not so good. After some time of usies , I'm happy of quality of the product. Light weight. Quite compact, overall good product. But unhappy with with it's price was drop RS 100, 2 day after I bought this product.

But unhappy with with it's price was drop RS 100, 2 day after I bought this product.

    This product really worthy the price, it provides you with better sound and bass quality in this range in comparison to other earbuds. It has a nice sound quality with Deep bass and the case with shinny chrome colour gives you a premium look and makes you feel that, yes you have really paid for it. My calling experience was overall average using them. One thing which I will suggest to improve is It's build quality. My earbuds, case lid is bit loose. Other wise it's good to go. I will recomend to purchase this instead of purchasing The ""Bassbuds Duo"".

    I am writing this review after using it for 3 days. I am amazed with many features that comes with this smartwatch at such affordable price whereas few things need to be improved upon.#Good Features:1. Great in look and light weight.2. Bluetooth calling with dialpad and contacts sharing3. Accurate heart beat, SPO2, steps counter and sleep sensor.4. Multiple features like Camera and music controls, weather info, AI voice controls etc.#Features to improve:1. Battery life lasted for 3 days with normal usage.2. Distance sensor does not seem correct after walking for 2-3 kms.3. More Watch faces could be added.4. Watch Da fit App could be improved as it does not have many fitness controls.Overall I am pretty satisfied with this smartwatch features and would recommend others to buy it.

    [Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback üòÄ and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.

    Writing this review after 10 days use. It's design and display superb & 1.83 inch display will give more stylish look.Touch also working fine. Battery back up is amazing & get up to 10days without blutooth connectivity, but with blutooth connectivity battery drain fast and hardly sustain two days max. Watch faces are just average and hope boat will add more faces in future updation. Blutooth connectivity with phone is sometimes tricky,cause BT will connect with phone only after disconnect with boat app( this issue happening sometimes). Call clarity, speaker sound and mic is good. Sensors are working but I'm not an expert to measure accuracy of values so don't know whether it's correct or not. 20 contact can save but sometimes name of saved contact not displaying on watch while gets calls. Over all 4‚≠ê product

    Everything is excellent at this price point . But I found a severe problem that when we connect this smartwatch with our smartphone and when we play music from a smartphone the music starts playing on the smartwatch speaker not in the phone speaker and there is a lot of connectivity issue it disconnects automatically after sometime auto start of the app not work properly one more problem which I faced is was when I call someone from my smart watch sometimes when I turn on the Bluetooth calling option after that also the option of calling stops or I can say that the option disables by the way the build quality is decent at this price point and we could not expect anything at this price point overall experience was good but I request to boat to solve this problem.A honest review from a boathead

Dust particles easily get attached to the strap and soo the strap gets dirty very fast.If you are looking for watch under 1.5k this is the best watch u can get.I am using this watch for 2 days and till now my experience is good with the watch except strap.They are giving soo much feature in watch so don't worry about the strap you can easily get a new strap from the market.I will upload more about the watch.Thankyou

    Pros1. Best looking smart watch in market (budget Apple Watch).2. Solid build quality with metal frame and silicon strap.3. Nice and rich features for little price4. Excellent battery life, definitely lasts for a week.5. Bright screen and nice visibility under day light.6. Perfectly working crown and back button.7. Speaker and clear mic addition is big plus.Cons1. Measurement accuracy is about 90-95%.2. Connectivity is some what problematic (disconnects when phone locked)3. Speaker sound is average and not adequate for noisy environment.ConclusionFinally, a best looking and perfectly build solid smart watch which offers great value for money with its features and battery life. Most features are working perfectly and it offers best performance. Clear and bright screen is good for most out door conditions. If you prefer to buy a smart watch with awesome build quality and stunning look with all features which we use daily at a little price then definitely this will be your pick..!

    I got this smartwatch during first day of the sale and was delivered within one day so thanks to Amazon. I am quite impressed with the build & design as the watch is very lightweight. Actually, the amoled screen got my attention which is rare to see at this price range and it's absolutely great. UI is also smooth and snappy but don't expect it to be equal with the watches that has ""Wear OS"". Performance wise, it shows all the notifications, can mute calls, has quick reply functionality which works for calls and normal messages only not the social media ones, can track daily activities and has so many sports mode. Now I have only used this watch for few hours so not the final verdict which I'll be updating after I use this watch for a long term.

    I am writing this review after using it for 3 days. I am amazed with many features that comes with this smartwatch at such affordable price whereas few things need to be improved upon.#Good Features:1. Great in look and light weight.2. Bluetooth calling with dialpad and contacts sharing3. Accurate heart beat, SPO2, steps counter and sleep sensor.4. Multiple features like Camera and music controls, weather info, AI voice controls etc.#Features to improve:1. Battery life lasted for 3 days with normal usage.2. Distance sensor does not seem correct after walking for 2-3 kms.3. More Watch faces could be added.4. Watch Da fit App could be improved as it does not have many fitness controls.Overall I am pretty satisfied with this smartwatch features and would recommend others to buy it.

    [Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback üòÄ and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky.

Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range.

    Writing this review after 10 days use. It's design and display superb & 1.83 inch display will give more stylish look.Touch also working fine. Battery back up is amazing & get up to 10days without blutooth connectivity, but with blutooth connectivity battery drain fast and hardly sustain two days max. Watch faces are just average and hope boat will add more faces in future updation.

    Everything is excellent at this price point . But I found a severe problem that when we connect this smartwatch with our smartphone and when we play music from a smartphone the music starts playing on the smartwatch speaker not in the phone speaker and there is a lot of connectivity issue it disconnects automatically after sometime auto start of the app not work properly one more problem which I faced is was when I call someone from my smart watch sometimes when I turn on the Bluetooth calling option after that also the option of calling stops or I can say that the option disables by the way the build quality is decent at this price point and we could not expect anything at this price point overall experience was good but I request to boat to solve this problem.A honest review from a boathead

    [Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback üòÄ and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.

    Writing this review after 10 days use. It's design and display superb & 1.83 inch display will give more stylish look.Touch also working fine. Battery back up is amazing & get up to 10days without blutooth connectivity, but with blutooth connectivity battery drain fast and hardly sustain two days max. Watch faces are just average and hope boat will add more faces in future updation. Blutooth connectivity with phone is sometimes tricky,cause BT will connect with phone only after disconnect with boat app( this issue happening sometimes). Call clarity, speaker sound and mic is good.

    it is the best watch you can get under Rs. 1499.It comes with large display and there is no lag in the displayBuild quality is of metal which makes is look more premiumThe quality of the strap is not good at all. Dust particles easily get attached to the strap and soo the strap gets dirty very fast.If you are looking for watch under 1.5k this is the best watch u can get.I am using this watch for 2 days and till now my experience is good with the watch except strap.They are giving soo much feature in watch so don't worry about the strap you can easily get a new strap from the market.I will upload more about the watch.Thankyou

    Pros1. Best looking smart watch in market (budget Apple Watch).2. Solid build quality with metal frame and silicon strap.3. Nice and rich features for little price4. Excellent battery life, definitely lasts for a week.5. Bright screen and nice visibility under day light.6. Perfectly working crown and back button.7. Speaker and clear mic addition is big plus.Cons1. Measurement accuracy is about 90-95%.2. Connectivity is some what problematic (disconnects when phone locked)3. Speaker sound is average and not adequate for noisy environment.ConclusionFinally, a best looking and perfectly build solid smart watch which offers great value for money with its features and battery life. Most features are working perfectly and it offers best performance. Clear and bright screen is good for most out door conditions.

    I got this smartwatch during first day of the sale and was delivered within one day so thanks to Amazon. I am quite impressed with the build & design as the watch is very lightweight. Actually, the amoled screen got my attention which is rare to see at this price range and it's absolutely great. UI is also smooth and snappy but don't expect it to be equal with the watches that has ""Wear OS"". Performance wise, it shows all the notifications, can mute calls, has quick reply functionality which works for calls and normal messages only not the social media ones, can track daily activities and has so many sports mode. Now I have only used this watch for few hours so not the final verdict which I'll be updating after I use this watch for a long term.

    Today only i recieved this watch at first instance it win my heart ....I was using it a whole day and i found some pros and cons of this watchPros# Amoled Display is very bright and nice# Look and design is premium# Bluetooth calling is awesome, speaker is loud and clear . Even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.# calculator features is useful# Multi Functional crown button is easy and useful .. Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine# strap quality is good and soft# TWS connecting features is also niceCons# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day# fingerprints are clearly visible on  Screen Glass .. i have attached the pic for it#Health Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..# AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.#Sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for Rs.3420/- including bank offer . For this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..Its my experience with this watch for just a one dayRest how it work for long run that depends..

    Everything is excellent at this price point . But I found a severe problem that when we connect this smartwatch with our smartphone and when we play music from a smartphone the music starts playing on the smartwatch speaker not in the phone speaker and there is a lot of connectivity issue it disconnects automatically after sometime auto start of the app not work properly one more problem which I faced is was when I call someone from my smart watch sometimes when I turn on the Bluetooth calling option after that also the option of calling stops or I can say that the option disables by the way the build quality is decent at this price point and we could not expect anything at this price point overall experience was good but I request to boat to solve this problem.A honest review from a boathead

    [Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback üòÄ and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.

    Writing this review after 10 days use. It's design and display superb & 1.83 inch display will give more stylish look.Touch also working fine. Battery back up is amazing & get up to 10days without blutooth connectivity, but with blutooth connectivity battery drain fast and hardly sustain two days max. Watch faces are just average and hope boat will add more faces in future updation. Blutooth connectivity with phone is sometimes tricky,cause BT will connect with phone only after disconnect with boat app( this issue happening sometimes). Call clarity, speaker sound and mic is good. Sensors are working but I'm not an expert to measure accuracy of values so don't know whether it's correct or not. 20 contact can save but sometimes name of saved contact not displaying on watch while gets calls. Over all 4‚≠ê product

    it is the best watch you can get under Rs. 1499.It comes with large display and there is no lag in the displayBuild quality is of metal which makes is look more premiumThe quality of the strap is not good at all. Dust particles easily get attached to the strap and soo the strap gets dirty very fast.If you are looking for watch under 1.5k this is the best watch u can get.I am using this watch for 2 days and till now my experience is good with the watch except strap.They are giving soo much feature in watch so don't worry about the strap you can easily get a new strap from the market.I will upload more about the watch.Thankyou

    Pros1. Best looking smart watch in market (budget Apple Watch).2. Solid build quality with metal frame and silicon strap.3. Nice and rich features for little price4. Excellent battery life, definitely lasts for a week.5. Bright screen and nice visibility under day light.6. Perfectly working crown and back button.7. Speaker and clear mic addition is big plus.Cons1. Measurement accuracy is about 90-95%.2. Connectivity is some what problematic (disconnects when phone locked)3. Speaker sound is average and not adequate for noisy environment.ConclusionFinally, a best looking and perfectly build solid smart watch which offers great value for money with its features and battery life. Most features are working perfectly and it offers best performance. Clear and bright screen is good for most out door conditions. If you prefer to buy a smart watch with awesome build quality and stunning look with all features which we use daily at a little price then definitely this will be your pick..!

    I got this smartwatch during first day of the sale and was delivered within one day so thanks to Amazon. I am quite impressed with the build & design as the watch is very lightweight. Actually, the amoled screen got my attention which is rare to see at this price range and it's absolutely great. UI is also smooth and snappy but don't expect it to be equal with the watches that has ""Wear OS"". Performance wise, it shows all the notifications, can mute calls, has quick reply functionality which works for calls and normal messages only not the social media ones, can track daily activities and has so many sports mode. Now I have only used this watch for few hours so not the final verdict which I'll be updating after I use this watch for a long term.

    Today only i recieved this watch at first instance it win my heart ....I was using it a whole day and i found some pros and cons of this watchPros# Amoled Display is very bright and nice# Look and design is premium# Bluetooth calling is awesome, speaker is loud and clear . Even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.# calculator features is useful# Multi Functional crown button is easy and useful .. Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine# strap quality is good and soft# TWS connecting features is also niceCons# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day# fingerprints are clearly visible on  Screen Glass .. i have attached the pic for it#Health Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..# AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.#Sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for Rs.3420/- including bank offer . For this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..Its my experience with this watch for just a one dayRest how it work for long run that depends..

    Looks good with its wide belt, has cool features packed in- loved the sports mode, good collection of watch faces and responsive sensor you can rely on for health status. Although the product is touted as for women, the watch seems a little too big on my 5.5 inch wrist, and the belt when closed on the first hole overlaps the screen.

No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.

    Writing this review after 10 days use. It's design and display superb & 1.83 inch display will give more stylish look.Touch also working fine. Battery back up is amazing & get up to 10days without blutooth connectivity, but with blutooth connectivity battery drain fast and hardly sustain two days max. Watch faces are just average and hope boat will add more faces in future updation. Blutooth connectivity with phone is sometimes tricky,cause BT will connect with phone only after disconnect with boat app( this issue happening sometimes). Call clarity, speaker sound and mic is good. Sensors are working but I'm not an expert to measure accuracy of values so don't know whether it's correct or not. 20 contact can save but sometimes name of saved contact not displaying on watch while gets calls. Over all 4‚≠ê product

    Everything is excellent at this price point . But I found a severe problem that when we connect this smartwatch with our smartphone and when we play music from a smartphone the music starts playing on the smartwatch speaker not in the phone speaker and there is a lot of connectivity issue it disconnects automatically after sometime auto start of the app not work properly one more problem which I faced is was when I call someone from my smart watch sometimes when I turn on the Bluetooth calling option after that also the option of calling stops or I can say that the option disables by the way the build quality is decent at this price point and we could not expect anything at this price point overall experience was good but I request to boat to solve this problem.A honest review from a boathead

    it is the best watch you can get under Rs. 1499.It comes with large display and there is no lag in the displayBuild quality is of metal which makes is look more premiumThe quality of the strap is not good at all. Dust particles easily get attached to the strap and soo the strap gets dirty very fast.If you are looking for watch under 1.5k this is the best watch u can get.I am using this watch for 2 days and till now my experience is good with the watch except strap.They are giving soo much feature in watch so don't worry about the strap you can easily get a new strap from the market.I will upload more about the watch.Thankyou

    Pros1. Best looking smart watch in market (budget Apple Watch).2. Solid build quality with metal frame and silicon strap.3. Nice and rich features for little price4. Excellent battery life, definitely lasts for a week.5. Bright screen and nice visibility under day light.6. Perfectly working crown and back button.7. Speaker and clear mic addition is big plus.Cons1. Measurement accuracy is about 90-95%.2. Connectivity is some what problematic (disconnects when phone locked)3. Speaker sound is average and not adequate for noisy environment.ConclusionFinally, a best looking and perfectly build solid smart watch which offers great value for money with its features and battery life. Most features are working perfectly and it offers best performance. Clear and bright screen is good for most out door conditions. If you prefer to buy a smart watch with awesome build quality and stunning look with all features which we use daily at a little price then definitely this will be your pick..!

    I got this smartwatch during first day of the sale and was delivered within one day so thanks to Amazon. I am quite impressed with the build & design as the watch is very lightweight. Actually, the amoled screen got my attention which is rare to see at this price range and it's absolutely great. UI is also smooth and snappy but don't expect it to be equal with the watches that has ""Wear OS"". Performance wise, it shows all the notifications, can mute calls, has quick reply functionality which works for calls and normal messages only not the social media ones, can track daily activities and has so many sports mode. Now I have only used this watch for few hours so not the final verdict which I'll be updating after I use this watch for a long term.

    I am writing this review after using it for 3 days. I am amazed with many features that comes with this smartwatch at such affordable price whereas few things need to be improved upon.#Good Features:1. Great in look and light weight.2. Bluetooth calling with dialpad and contacts sharing3. Accurate heart beat, SPO2, steps counter and sleep sensor.4. Multiple features like Camera and music controls, weather info, AI voice controls etc.#Features to improve:1. Battery life lasted for 3 days with normal usage.2. Distance sensor does not seem correct after walking for 2-3 kms.3. More Watch faces could be added.4. Watch Da fit App could be improved as it does not have many fitness controls.Overall I am pretty satisfied with this smartwatch features and would recommend others to buy it.

    it is the best watch you can get under Rs. 1499.It comes with large display and there is no lag in the displayBuild quality is of metal which makes is look more premiumThe quality of the strap is not good at all. Dust particles easily get attached to the strap and soo the strap gets dirty very fast.If you are looking for watch under 1.5k this is the best watch u can get.I am using this watch for 2 days and till now my experience is good with the watch except strap.They are giving soo much feature in watch so don't worry about the strap you can easily get a new strap from the market.I will upload more about the watch.Thankyou

    Pros1. Best looking smart watch in market (budget Apple Watch).2. Solid build quality with metal frame and silicon strap.3. Nice and rich features for little price4. Excellent battery life, definitely lasts for a week.5. Bright screen and nice visibility under day light.6. Perfectly working crown and back button.7. Speaker and clear mic addition is big plus.Cons1. Measurement accuracy is about 90-95%.2. Connectivity is some what problematic (disconnects when phone locked)3. Speaker sound is average and not adequate for noisy environment.ConclusionFinally, a best looking and perfectly build solid smart watch which offers great value for money with its features and battery life. Most features are working perfectly and it offers best performance. Clear and bright screen is good for most out door conditions. If you prefer to buy a smart watch with awesome build quality and stunning look with all features which we use daily at a little price then definitely this will be your pick..!

    I got this smartwatch during first day of the sale and was delivered within one day so thanks to Amazon. I am quite impressed with the build & design as the watch is very lightweight. Actually, the amoled screen got my attention which is rare to see at this price range and it's absolutely great. UI is also smooth and snappy but don't expect it to be equal with the watches that has ""Wear OS"". Performance wise, it shows all the notifications, can mute calls, has quick reply functionality which works for calls and normal messages only not the social media ones, can track daily activities and has so many sports mode. Now I have only used this watch for few hours so not the final verdict which I'll be updating after I use this watch for a long term.

    Today only i recieved this watch at first instance it win my heart ....I was using it a whole day and i found some pros and cons of this watchPros# Amoled Display is very bright and nice# Look and design is premium# Bluetooth calling is awesome, speaker is loud and clear . Even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.# calculator features is useful# Multi Functional crown button is easy and useful .. Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine# strap quality is good and soft# TWS connecting features is also niceCons# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day# fingerprints are clearly visible on  Screen Glass .. i have attached the pic for it#Health Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..# AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.#Sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for Rs.3420/- including bank offer . For this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..Its my experience with this watch for just a one dayRest how it work for long run that depends..

    This watch is having a multiple features pertinent to the fitness. Product works fine till date. If any problem arises with these watches it's getting difficult to find a service centre to get it repaired.

    Looks good with its wide belt, has cool features packed in- loved the sports mode, good collection of watch faces and responsive sensor you can rely on for health status. Although the product is touted as for women, the watch seems a little too big on my 5.5 inch wrist, and the belt when closed on the first hole overlaps the screen.

    [Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback üòÄ and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.

    Writing this review after 10 days use. It's design and display superb & 1.83 inch display will give more stylish look.Touch also working fine. Battery back up is amazing & get up to 10days without blutooth connectivity, but with blutooth connectivity battery drain fast and hardly sustain two days max. Watch faces are just average and hope boat will add more faces in future updation. Blutooth connectivity with phone is sometimes tricky,cause BT will connect with phone only after disconnect with boat app( this issue happening sometimes). Call clarity, speaker sound and mic is good. Sensors are working but I'm not an expert to measure accuracy of values so don't know whether it's correct or not. 20 contact can save but sometimes name of saved contact not displaying on watch while gets calls. Over all 4‚≠ê product

    it is the best watch you can get under Rs. 1499.It comes with large display and there is no lag in the displayBuild quality is of metal which makes is look more premiumThe quality of the strap is not good at all. Dust particles easily get attached to the strap and soo the strap gets dirty very fast.If you are looking for watch under 1.5k this is the best watch u can get.I am using this watch for 2 days and till now my experience is good with the watch except strap.They are giving soo much feature in watch so don't worry about the strap you can easily get a new strap from the market.I will upload more about the watch.Thankyou

    Pros1. Best looking smart watch in market (budget Apple Watch).2. Solid build quality with metal frame and silicon strap.3. Nice and rich features for little price4. Excellent battery life, definitely lasts for a week.5. Bright screen and nice visibility under day light.6. Perfectly working crown and back button.7. Speaker and clear mic addition is big plus.Cons1. Measurement accuracy is about 90-95%.2. Connectivity is some what problematic (disconnects when phone locked)3. Speaker sound is average and not adequate for noisy environment.ConclusionFinally, a best looking and perfectly build solid smart watch which offers great value for money with its features and battery life. Most features are working perfectly and it offers best performance. Clear and bright screen is good for most out door conditions. If you prefer to buy a smart watch with awesome build quality and stunning look with all features which we use daily at a little price then definitely this will be your pick..!

    I got this smartwatch during first day of the sale and was delivered within one day so thanks to Amazon. I am quite impressed with the build & design as the watch is very lightweight. Actually, the amoled screen got my attention which is rare to see at this price range and it's absolutely great. UI is also smooth and snappy but don't expect it to be equal with the watches that has ""Wear OS"". Performance wise, it shows all the notifications, can mute calls, has quick reply functionality which works for calls and normal messages only not the social media ones, can track daily activities and has so many sports mode. Now I have only used this watch for few hours so not the final verdict which I'll be updating after I use this watch for a long term.

    Today only i recieved this watch at first instance it win my heart ....I was using it a whole day and i found some pros and cons of this watchPros# Amoled Display is very bright and nice# Look and design is premium# Bluetooth calling is awesome, speaker is loud and clear . Even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.# calculator features is useful# Multi Functional crown button is easy and useful .. Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine# strap quality is good and soft# TWS connecting features is also niceCons# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day# fingerprints are clearly visible on  Screen Glass .. i have attached the pic for it#Health Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..# AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.#Sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for Rs.3420/- including bank offer . For this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..Its my experience with this watch for just a one dayRest how it work for long run that depends..

    This watch is having a multiple features pertinent to the fitness. Product works fine till date. If any problem arises with these watches it's getting difficult to find a service centre to get it repaired.

    Looks good with its wide belt, has cool features packed in- loved the sports mode, good collection of watch faces and responsive sensor you can rely on for health status. Although the product is touted as for women, the watch seems a little too big on my 5.5 inch wrist, and the belt when closed on the first hole overlaps the screen.

    [Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback üòÄ and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.

    Writing this review after 10 days use. It's design and display superb & 1.83 inch display will give more stylish look.Touch also working fine. Battery back up is amazing & get up to 10days without blutooth connectivity, but with blutooth connectivity battery drain fast and hardly sustain two days max. Watch faces are just average and hope boat will add more faces in future updation. Blutooth connectivity with phone is sometimes tricky,cause BT will connect with phone only after disconnect with boat app( this issue happening sometimes). Call clarity, speaker sound and mic is good. Sensors are working but I'm not an expert to measure accuracy of values so don't know whether it's correct or not. 20 contact can save but sometimes name of saved contact not displaying on watch while gets calls. Over all 4‚≠ê product

    Everything is excellent at this price point . But I found a severe problem that when we connect this smartwatch with our smartphone and when we play music from a smartphone the music starts playing on the smartwatch speaker not in the phone speaker and there is a lot of connectivity issue it disconnects automatically after sometime auto start of the app not work properly one more problem which I faced is was when I call someone from my smart watch sometimes when I turn on the Bluetooth calling option after that also the option of calling stops or I can say that the option disables by the way the build quality is decent at this price point and we could not expect anything at this price point overall experience was good but I request to boat to solve this problem.A honest review from a boathead

Dust particles easily get attached to the strap and soo the strap gets dirty very fast.If you are looking for watch under 1.5k this is the best watch u can get.I am using this watch for 2 days and till now my experience is good with the watch except strap.They are giving soo much feature in watch so don't worry about the strap you can easily get a new strap from the market.I will upload more about the watch.Thankyou

    Pros1. Best looking smart watch in market (budget Apple Watch).2. Solid build quality with metal frame and silicon strap.3. Nice and rich features for little price4. Excellent battery life, definitely lasts for a week.5. Bright screen and nice visibility under day light.6. Perfectly working crown and back button.7. Speaker and clear mic addition is big plus.Cons1. Measurement accuracy is about 90-95%.2. Connectivity is some what problematic (disconnects when phone locked)3. Speaker sound is average and not adequate for noisy environment.ConclusionFinally, a best looking and perfectly build solid smart watch which offers great value for money with its features and battery life. Most features are working perfectly and it offers best performance. Clear and bright screen is good for most out door conditions. If you prefer to buy a smart watch with awesome build quality and stunning look with all features which we use daily at a little price then definitely this will be your pick..!

    I got this smartwatch during first day of the sale and was delivered within one day so thanks to Amazon. I am quite impressed with the build & design as the watch is very lightweight. Actually, the amoled screen got my attention which is rare to see at this price range and it's absolutely great. UI is also smooth and snappy but don't expect it to be equal with the watches that has ""Wear OS"". Performance wise, it shows all the notifications, can mute calls, has quick reply functionality which works for calls and normal messages only not the social media ones, can track daily activities and has so many sports mode. Now I have only used this watch for few hours so not the final verdict which I'll be updating after I use this watch for a long term.

    Today only i recieved this watch at first instance it win my heart ....I was using it a whole day and i found some pros and cons of this watchPros# Amoled Display is very bright and nice# Look and design is premium# Bluetooth calling is awesome, speaker is loud and clear . Even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.# calculator features is useful# Multi Functional crown button is easy and useful .. Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine# strap quality is good and soft# TWS connecting features is also niceCons# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day# fingerprints are clearly visible on  Screen Glass .. i have attached the pic for it#Health Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..# AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.#Sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for Rs.3420/- including bank offer . For this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..Its my experience with this watch for just a one dayRest how it work for long run that depends..

    This watch is having a multiple features pertinent to the fitness. Product works fine till date. If any problem arises with these watches it's getting difficult to find a service centre to get it repaired. I hope these companies reach out as soon as possible and resolve the issue whenever we reach out to the customer care.

    Looks good with its wide belt, has cool features packed in- loved the sports mode, good collection of watch faces and responsive sensor you can rely on for health status. Although the product is touted as for women, the watch seems a little too big on my 5.5 inch wrist, and the belt when closed on the first hole overlaps the screen.

    [Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback üòÄ and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.

    Writing this review after 10 days use. It's design and display superb & 1.83 inch display will give more stylish look.Touch also working fine. Battery back up is amazing & get up to 10days without blutooth connectivity, but with blutooth connectivity battery drain fast and hardly sustain two days max. Watch faces are just average and hope boat will add more faces in future updation. Blutooth connectivity with phone is sometimes tricky,cause BT will connect with phone only after disconnect with boat app( this issue happening sometimes). Call clarity, speaker sound and mic is good. Sensors are working but I'm not an expert to measure accuracy of values so don't know whether it's correct or not. 20 contact can save but sometimes name of saved contact not displaying on watch while gets calls. Over all 4‚≠ê product

    Everything is excellent at this price point . But I found a severe problem that when we connect this smartwatch with our smartphone and when we play music from a smartphone the music starts playing on the smartwatch speaker not in the phone speaker and there is a lot of connectivity issue it disconnects automatically after sometime auto start of the app not work properly one more problem which I faced is was when I call someone from my smart watch sometimes when I turn on the Bluetooth calling option after that also the option of calling stops or I can say that the option disables by the way the build quality is decent at this price point and we could not expect anything at this price point overall experience was good but I request to boat to solve this problem.A honest review from a boathead

    I got this smartwatch during first day of the sale and was delivered within one day so thanks to Amazon. I am quite impressed with the build & design as the watch is very lightweight. Actually, the amoled screen got my attention which is rare to see at this price range and it's absolutely great. UI is also smooth and snappy but don't expect it to be equal with the watches that has ""Wear OS"". Performance wise, it shows all the notifications, can mute calls, has quick reply functionality which works for calls and normal messages only not the social media ones, can track daily activities and has so many sports mode. Now I have only used this watch for few hours so not the final verdict which I'll be updating after I use this watch for a long term.

    it is the best watch you can get under Rs. 1499.It comes with large display and there is no lag in the displayBuild quality is of metal which makes is look more premiumThe quality of the strap is not good at all. Dust particles easily get attached to the strap and soo the strap gets dirty very fast.If you are looking for watch under 1.5k this is the best watch u can get.I am using this watch for 2 days and till now my experience is good with the watch except strap.They are giving soo much feature in watch so don't worry about the strap you can easily get a new strap from the market.I will upload more about the watch.Thankyou

    I am writing this review after using it for 3 days. I am amazed with many features that comes with this smartwatch at such affordable price whereas few things need to be improved upon.#Good Features:1. Great in look and light weight.2. Bluetooth calling with dialpad and contacts sharing3. Accurate heart beat, SPO2, steps counter and sleep sensor.4. Multiple features like Camera and music controls, weather info, AI voice controls etc.#Features to improve:1. Battery life lasted for 3 days with normal usage.2. Distance sensor does not seem correct after walking for 2-3 kms.3. More Watch faces could be added.4. Watch Da fit App could be improved as it does not have many fitness controls.Overall I am pretty satisfied with this smartwatch features and would recommend others to buy it.

    [Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback üòÄ and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.

    Writing this review after 10 days use. It's design and display superb & 1.83 inch display will give more stylish look.Touch also working fine. Battery back up is amazing & get up to 10days without blutooth connectivity, but with blutooth connectivity battery drain fast and hardly sustain two days max. Watch faces are just average and hope boat will add more faces in future updation. Blutooth connectivity with phone is sometimes tricky,cause BT will connect with phone only after disconnect with boat app( this issue happening sometimes). Call clarity, speaker sound and mic is good. Sensors are working but I'm not an expert to measure accuracy of values so don't know whether it's correct or not. 20 contact can save but sometimes name of saved contact not displaying on watch while gets calls. Over all 4‚≠ê product

    Everything is excellent at this price point . But I found a severe problem that when we connect this smartwatch with our smartphone and when we play music from a smartphone the music starts playing on the smartwatch speaker not in the phone speaker and there is a lot of connectivity issue it disconnects automatically after sometime auto start of the app not work properly one more problem which I faced is was when I call someone from my smart watch sometimes when I turn on the Bluetooth calling option after that also the option of calling stops or I can say that the option disables by the way the build quality is decent at this price point and we could not expect anything at this price point overall experience was good but I request to boat to solve this problem.A honest review from a boathead

    I got this smartwatch during first day of the sale and was delivered within one day so thanks to Amazon. I am quite impressed with the build & design as the watch is very lightweight. Actually, the amoled screen got my attention which is rare to see at this price range and it's absolutely great. UI is also smooth and snappy but don't expect it to be equal with the watches that has ""Wear OS"". Performance wise, it shows all the notifications, can mute calls, has quick reply functionality which works for calls and normal messages only not the social media ones, can track daily activities and has so many sports mode. Now I have only used this watch for few hours so not the final verdict which I'll be updating after I use this watch for a long term.

    Today only i recieved this watch at first instance it win my heart ....I was using it a whole day and i found some pros and cons of this watchPros# Amoled Display is very bright and nice# Look and design is premium# Bluetooth calling is awesome, speaker is loud and clear . Even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.# calculator features is useful# Multi Functional crown button is easy and useful .. Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine# strap quality is good and soft# TWS connecting features is also niceCons# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day# fingerprints are clearly visible on  Screen Glass .. i have attached the pic for it#Health Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..# AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.#Sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for Rs.3420/- including bank offer . For this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..Its my experience with this watch for just a one dayRest how it work for long run that depends..

    This watch is having a multiple features pertinent to the fitness. Product works fine till date. If any problem arises with these watches it's getting difficult to find a service centre to get it repaired. I hope these companies reach out as soon as possible and resolve the issue whenever we reach out to the customer care.

    Looks good with its wide belt, has cool features packed in- loved the sports mode, good collection of watch faces and responsive sensor you can rely on for health status. Although the product is touted as for women, the watch seems a little too big on my 5.5 inch wrist, and the belt when closed on the first hole overlaps the screen.

    [Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback üòÄ and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.

    Writing this review after 10 days use. It's design and display superb & 1.83 inch display will give more stylish look.Touch also working fine. Battery back up is amazing & get up to 10days without blutooth connectivity, but with blutooth connectivity battery drain fast and hardly sustain two days max. Watch faces are just average and hope boat will add more faces in future updation. Blutooth connectivity with phone is sometimes tricky,cause BT will connect with phone only after disconnect with boat app( this issue happening sometimes). Call clarity, speaker sound and mic is good. Sensors are working but I'm not an expert to measure accuracy of values so don't know whether it's correct or not. 20 contact can save but sometimes name of saved contact not displaying on watch while gets calls. Over all 4‚≠ê product

    Everything is excellent at this price point . But I found a severe problem that when we connect this smartwatch with our smartphone and when we play music from a smartphone the music starts playing on the smartwatch speaker not in the phone speaker and there is a lot of connectivity issue it disconnects automatically after sometime auto start of the app not work properly one more problem which I faced is was when I call someone from my smart watch sometimes when I turn on the Bluetooth calling option after that also the option of calling stops or I can say that the option disables by the way the build quality is decent at this price point and we could not expect anything at this price point overall experience was good but I request to boat to solve this problem.A honest review from a boathead

    I got this smartwatch during first day of the sale and was delivered within one day so thanks to Amazon. I am quite impressed with the build & design as the watch is very lightweight. Actually, the amoled screen got my attention which is rare to see at this price range and it's absolutely great. UI is also smooth and snappy but don't expect it to be equal with the watches that has ""Wear OS"". Performance wise, it shows all the notifications, can mute calls, has quick reply functionality which works for calls and normal messages only not the social media ones, can track daily activities and has so many sports mode. Now I have only used this watch for few hours so not the final verdict which I'll be updating after I use this watch for a long term.

    Today only i recieved this watch at first instance it win my heart ....I was using it a whole day and i found some pros and cons of this watchPros# Amoled Display is very bright and nice# Look and design is premium# Bluetooth calling is awesome, speaker is loud and clear . Even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.# calculator features is useful# Multi Functional crown button is easy and useful .. Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine# strap quality is good and soft# TWS connecting features is also niceCons# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day# fingerprints are clearly visible on  Screen Glass .. i have attached the pic for it#Health Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..# AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.#Sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for Rs.3420/- including bank offer . For this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..Its my experience with this watch for just a one dayRest how it work for long run that depends..

    This watch is having a multiple features pertinent to the fitness. Product works fine till date. If any problem arises with these watches it's getting difficult to find a service centre to get it repaired. I hope these companies reach out as soon as possible and resolve the issue whenever we reach out to the customer care.

    Looks good with its wide belt, has cool features packed in- loved the sports mode, good collection of watch faces and responsive sensor you can rely on for health status. Although the product is touted as for women, the watch seems a little too big on my 5.5 inch wrist, and the belt when closed on the first hole overlaps the screen.

    [Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback üòÄ and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.

    Writing this review after 10 days use. It's design and display superb & 1.83 inch display will give more stylish look.Touch also working fine. Battery back up is amazing & get up to 10days without blutooth connectivity, but with blutooth connectivity battery drain fast and hardly sustain two days max. Watch faces are just average and hope boat will add more faces in future updation. Blutooth connectivity with phone is sometimes tricky,cause BT will connect with phone only after disconnect with boat app( this issue happening sometimes). Call clarity, speaker sound and mic is good. Sensors are working but I'm not an expert to measure accuracy of values so don't know whether it's correct or not. 20 contact can save but sometimes name of saved contact not displaying on watch while gets calls. Over all 4‚≠ê product

    Everything is excellent at this price point . But I found a severe problem that when we connect this smartwatch with our smartphone and when we play music from a smartphone the music starts playing on the smartwatch speaker not in the phone speaker and there is a lot of connectivity issue it disconnects automatically after sometime auto start of the app not work properly one more problem which I faced is was when I call someone from my smart watch sometimes when I turn on the Bluetooth calling option after that also the option of calling stops or I can say that the option disables by the way the build quality is decent at this price point and we could not expect anything at this price point overall experience was good but I request to boat to solve this problem.A honest review from a boathead

Now I have only used this watch for few hours so not the final verdict which I'll be updating after I use this watch for a long term.

    You will not feel premium quality with this camera. It has average quality video, low quality during night. Software needs improvements. Motion detection doesn't work that well and motion tracking is bad. If you need have basic camera with little less price then it might be good option but if better quality is required I will suggest Imou with little more price.

    The camera has lot of issues which outweighs its features.1. It connected to the WiFi router, but the WiFi disconnects every 10-15 seconds and reconnects again. The issue is not there when connected to a different WiFi router. Couldn't find the reason why this happens. I have 98% signal in the camera. Customer care wasn't any help. I can see that a lot of people have the same issue.2. The camera announces ""disconnected from WiFi"" and ""connecting to WiFi"" everytime it connects. This is weird, because we don't want others to know that the security camera is disconnected. An app notification is all that is required.3. This camera has motion tracking, but it seems not working correctly. The camera doesn't always go back to its original position after the movement stops. Hence I've disabled this feature in the app.4. Also, the camera is changing its position slightly for 2 days at night. So the footages are useless until it is manually moved back to the initial position. This is totally unacceptable behavior.5. Night vision is too bad. It is grainy. Looks like it doesn't have DNR / digital noise reduction. Video is also dull at night. It is usable only if used in a small room, or there is some light. If used outdoors (Use under the shade. Its not weather proof), turn on some light throughout the night. Otherwise night vision will be too dark and dull.6. Moving the camera position from the app instantly moves the camera lens. But the video has a lot of lag and it is difficult to control it from the app.7. Connecting to the video stream is laggy and it connects to the camera half of the time. Other time, we have to try again from the app.So far all Cons. Now the pros are:1. It has good day time vision. It is excellent for the price for daytime use. No issues during the day.2. The motion detection notifications are good. We can see snapshots of the motion detection alerts. This is beneficial since we can see who or what moved in the camera field of view without playing each motion detection video. A quick glance can give a lot of information. I own Tapo cameras which gives this feature only with their paid subscription.3. This camera has LAN port, unlike other turret cameras in this price range.4. The camera has ONVIF support, so it can connect to NVR. (I haven't tested this feature yet).I own and also have shared multiple Tapo security cameras and they all were pretty good. Bought this CP Plus camera for someone else because of the price, features and the brand value, but the software issues made the user experience too bad. The issues make this camera unreliable and unusable for me.

    I really wanted to give it 5 stars. But for the past few weeks or months, I am not sure, it has shown some strange problems, like auto-disconnecting from wifi and the light blinking from yellow to red. There are some instructions in the booklet, but I don't have the time to read them. I want peace of mind, which it gave me for a few months after installing it. Unfortunately, for the past few weeks, it has not been working flawlessly; sometimes the signal is so weak that it is not possible to view live camera from the Tapo mobile app. I don't know if it's a software issue or a weak wifi signal causing the problem. Otherwise, this is an excellent product at a very affordable price. Camera quality and build quality are top of the line.

    I installed this camera 3 days ago. It is pretty light, easy to setup and has been working well so far. Notifications have very little delay and app works fine as well. I also installed the SDHC card in it today. App allows me to control the recording behavior - whether you want continuous recording or recording only on detections (which significantly optimizes the storage). It also loops so once the memory is full, it will start overwriting the old one.One significant flaw that prevented it from getting 5 star is that they upsell their subscription plan for even the rich notifications. Getting a thumbnail of the event or clip of video in notifications is very critical to quickly review and triage however in order to enable the rich thumbnail, they still want to you to sign up for the monthly or yearly plan. I am ok paying money if I want to use their cloud storage, but thumbnail / video clip could have been fully generated on the device and should have been offered without the forcing function of online storage.My other Google nest camera sends me rich notification without any subscription.

    Got it for 1800, but it certainly isn't worth it. The rotating feature is nice but the setup was very difficult. Ultimately had to replace and get another unit. New unit connected quickly but again there are many issues with it.The camera lags a LOT when the distance between wifi and camera is large. When near the wifi ~4 feet there is almost no lag. Which won't be practical most times.The wire is only 6.5ft (small) which makes it difficult to mount on the ceiling. And the app's UI is very bad. I use it on Ipad and it isn't adjusted accordingly meaning the UI is only compatible for phone.Overall I'd prefer the tapo with no rotation because it has better connectivity and UI.

    I really wanted to give it 5 stars. But for the past few weeks or months, I am not sure, it has shown some strange problems, like auto-disconnecting from wifi and the light blinking from yellow to red. There are some instructions in the booklet, but I don't have the time to read them. I want peace of mind, which it gave me for a few months after installing it. Unfortunately, for the past few weeks, it has not been working flawlessly; sometimes the signal is so weak that it is not possible to view live camera from the Tapo mobile app. I don't know if it's a software issue or a weak wifi signal causing the problem. Otherwise, this is an excellent product at a very affordable price. Camera quality and build quality are top of the line.

    I installed this camera 3 days ago. It is pretty light, easy to setup and has been working well so far. Notifications have very little delay and app works fine as well. I also installed the SDHC card in it today. App allows me to control the recording behavior - whether you want continuous recording or recording only on detections (which significantly optimizes the storage). It also loops so once the memory is full, it will start overwriting the old one.One significant flaw that prevented it from getting 5 star is that they upsell their subscription plan for even the rich notifications. Getting a thumbnail of the event or clip of video in notifications is very critical to quickly review and triage however in order to enable the rich thumbnail, they still want to you to sign up for the monthly or yearly plan. I am ok paying money if I want to use their cloud storage, but thumbnail / video clip could have been fully generated on the device and should have been offered without the forcing function of online storage.My other Google nest camera sends me rich notification without any subscription.

    Got it for 1800, but it certainly isn't worth it. The rotating feature is nice but the setup was very difficult. Ultimately had to replace and get another unit. New unit connected quickly but again there are many issues with it.The camera lags a LOT when the distance between wifi and camera is large. When near the wifi ~4 feet there is almost no lag. Which won't be practical most times.The wire is only 6.5ft (small) which makes it difficult to mount on the ceiling. And the app's UI is very bad. I use it on Ipad and it isn't adjusted accordingly meaning the UI is only compatible for phone.Overall I'd prefer the tapo with no rotation because it has better connectivity and UI.

    You will not feel premium quality with this camera. It has average quality video, low quality during night. Software needs improvements. Motion detection doesn't work that well and motion tracking is bad. If you need have basic camera with little less price then it might be good option but if better quality is required I will suggest Imou with little more price.

    The camera has lot of issues which outweighs its features.1. It connected to the WiFi router, but the WiFi disconnects every 10-15 seconds and reconnects again. The issue is not there when connected to a different WiFi router. Couldn't find the reason why this happens. I have 98% signal in the camera. Customer care wasn't any help. I can see that a lot of people have the same issue.2. The camera announces ""disconnected from WiFi"" and ""connecting to WiFi"" everytime it connects. This is weird, because we don't want others to know that the security camera is disconnected. An app notification is all that is required.3. This camera has motion tracking, but it seems not working correctly. The camera doesn't always go back to its original position after the movement stops. Hence I've disabled this feature in the app.4. Also, the camera is changing its position slightly for 2 days at night. So the footages are useless until it is manually moved back to the initial position. This is totally unacceptable behavior.5. Night vision is too bad. It is grainy. Looks like it doesn't have DNR / digital noise reduction. Video is also dull at night. It is usable only if used in a small room, or there is some light. If used outdoors (Use under the shade. Its not weather proof), turn on some light throughout the night. Otherwise night vision will be too dark and dull.6. Moving the camera position from the app instantly moves the camera lens. But the video has a lot of lag and it is difficult to control it from the app.7. Connecting to the video stream is laggy and it connects to the camera half of the time. Other time, we have to try again from the app.So far all Cons. Now the pros are:1. It has good day time vision. It is excellent for the price for daytime use. No issues during the day.2. The motion detection notifications are good. We can see snapshots of the motion detection alerts. This is beneficial since we can see who or what moved in the camera field of view without playing each motion detection video. A quick glance can give a lot of information. I own Tapo cameras which gives this feature only with their paid subscription.3. This camera has LAN port, unlike other turret cameras in this price range.4. The camera has ONVIF support, so it can connect to NVR. (I haven't tested this feature yet).I own and also have shared multiple Tapo security cameras and they all were pretty good. Bought this CP Plus camera for someone else because of the price, features and the brand value, but the software issues made the user experience too bad. The issues make this camera unreliable and unusable for me.

Other time, we have to try again from the app.So far all Cons. Now the pros are:1. It has good day time vision. It is excellent for the price for daytime use. No issues during the day.2. The motion detection notifications are good. We can see snapshots of the motion detection alerts. This is beneficial since we can see who or what moved in the camera field of view without playing each motion detection video. A quick glance can give a lot of information. I own Tapo cameras which gives this feature only with their paid subscription.3. This camera has LAN port, unlike other turret cameras in this price range.4. The camera has ONVIF support, so it can connect to NVR. (I haven't tested this feature yet).I own and also have shared multiple Tapo security cameras and they all were pretty good. Bought this CP Plus camera for someone else because of the price, features and the brand value, but the software issues made the user experience too bad. The issues make this camera unreliable and unusable for me.

    I really wanted to give it 5 stars. But for the past few weeks or months, I am not sure, it has shown some strange problems, like auto-disconnecting from wifi and the light blinking from yellow to red. There are some instructions in the booklet, but I don't have the time to read them. I want peace of mind, which it gave me for a few months after installing it. Unfortunately, for the past few weeks, it has not been working flawlessly; sometimes the signal is so weak that it is not possible to view live camera from the Tapo mobile app. I don't know if it's a software issue or a weak wifi signal causing the problem. Otherwise, this is an excellent product at a very affordable price. Camera quality and build quality are top of the line.

    I installed this camera 3 days ago. It is pretty light, easy to setup and has been working well so far. Notifications have very little delay and app works fine as well. I also installed the SDHC card in it today. App allows me to control the recording behavior - whether you want continuous recording or recording only on detections (which significantly optimizes the storage). It also loops so once the memory is full, it will start overwriting the old one.One significant flaw that prevented it from getting 5 star is that they upsell their subscription plan for even the rich notifications. Getting a thumbnail of the event or clip of video in notifications is very critical to quickly review and triage however in order to enable the rich thumbnail, they still want to you to sign up for the monthly or yearly plan. I am ok paying money if I want to use their cloud storage, but thumbnail / video clip could have been fully generated on the device and should have been offered without the forcing function of online storage.My other Google nest camera sends me rich notification without any subscription.

    Got it for 1800, but it certainly isn't worth it. The rotating feature is nice but the setup was very difficult. Ultimately had to replace and get another unit. New unit connected quickly but again there are many issues with it.The camera lags a LOT when the distance between wifi and camera is large. When near the wifi ~4 feet there is almost no lag. Which won't be practical most times.The wire is only 6.5ft (small) which makes it difficult to mount on the ceiling. And the app's UI is very bad. I use it on Ipad and it isn't adjusted accordingly meaning the UI is only compatible for phone.Overall I'd prefer the tapo with no rotation because it has better connectivity and UI.

Unfortunately, for the past few weeks, it has not been working flawlessly; sometimes the signal is so weak that it is not possible to view live camera from the Tapo mobile app. I don't know if it's a software issue or a weak wifi signal causing the problem. Otherwise, this is an excellent product at a very affordable price. Camera quality and build quality are top of the line.

    We should have a feature of non rotating if we dont want, sometimes rotating causes it to move to an angle which we dont want and also why cant it rotate without a noise, the noise catches attention

    I installed this camera 3 days ago. It is pretty light, easy to setup and has been working well so far. Notifications have very little delay and app works fine as well. I also installed the SDHC card in it today. App allows me to control the recording behavior - whether you want continuous recording or recording only on detections (which significantly optimizes the storage). It also loops so once the memory is full, it will start overwriting the old one.One significant flaw that prevented it from getting 5 star is that they upsell their subscription plan for even the rich notifications. Getting a thumbnail of the event or clip of video in notifications is very critical to quickly review and triage however in order to enable the rich thumbnail, they still want to you to sign up for the monthly or yearly plan. I am ok paying money if I want to use their cloud storage, but thumbnail / video clip could have been fully generated on the device and should have been offered without the forcing function of online storage.My other Google nest camera sends me rich notification without any subscription.

    The picture quality is nice. It took me multiple attempts to pair it and activate it.. but that was due to inccorect password..:P. But overall I am satisfied with the product. But 1 thing which I am not so satisfies is the pan or tilt movement. It is not smooth and prompt. Let see how it works in future.But atlast, guys if you are thinking for a wireless camera, you can think for this product too.

    Got it for 1800, but it certainly isn't worth it. The rotating feature is nice but the setup was very difficult. Ultimately had to replace and get another unit. New unit connected quickly but again there are many issues with it.The camera lags a LOT when the distance between wifi and camera is large. When near the wifi ~4 feet there is almost no lag. Which won't be practical most times.The wire is only 6.5ft (small) which makes it difficult to mount on the ceiling. And the app's UI is very bad. I use it on Ipad and it isn't adjusted accordingly meaning the UI is only compatible for phone.Overall I'd prefer the tapo with no rotation because it has better connectivity and UI.

    You will not feel premium quality with this camera. It has average quality video, low quality during night. Software needs improvements. Motion detection doesn't work that well and motion tracking is bad. If you need have basic camera with little less price then it might be good option but if better quality is required I will suggest Imou with little more price.

    The camera has lot of issues which outweighs its features.1. It connected to the WiFi router, but the WiFi disconnects every 10-15 seconds and reconnects again. The issue is not there when connected to a different WiFi router. Couldn't find the reason why this happens. I have 98% signal in the camera. Customer care wasn't any help. I can see that a lot of people have the same issue.2. The camera announces ""disconnected from WiFi"" and ""connecting to WiFi"" everytime it connects. This is weird, because we don't want others to know that the security camera is disconnected. An app notification is all that is required.3. This camera has motion tracking, but it seems not working correctly. The camera doesn't always go back to its original position after the movement stops. Hence I've disabled this feature in the app.4. Also, the camera is changing its position slightly for 2 days at night. So the footages are useless until it is manually moved back to the initial position. This is totally unacceptable behavior.5. Night vision is too bad. It is grainy. Looks like it doesn't have DNR / digital noise reduction. Video is also dull at night. It is usable only if used in a small room, or there is some light. If used outdoors (Use under the shade. Its not weather proof), turn on some light throughout the night. Otherwise night vision will be too dark and dull.6. Moving the camera position from the app instantly moves the camera lens. But the video has a lot of lag and it is difficult to control it from the app.7. Connecting to the video stream is laggy and it connects to the camera half of the time. Other time, we have to try again from the app.So far all Cons. Now the pros are:1. It has good day time vision. It is excellent for the price for daytime use. No issues during the day.2. The motion detection notifications are good. We can see snapshots of the motion detection alerts. This is beneficial since we can see who or what moved in the camera field of view without playing each motion detection video. A quick glance can give a lot of information. I own Tapo cameras which gives this feature only with their paid subscription.3. This camera has LAN port, unlike other turret cameras in this price range.4. The camera has ONVIF support, so it can connect to NVR. (I haven't tested this feature yet).I own and also have shared multiple Tapo security cameras and they all were pretty good. Bought this CP Plus camera for someone else because of the price, features and the brand value, but the software issues made the user experience too bad. The issues make this camera unreliable and unusable for me.

But for the past few weeks or months, I am not sure, it has shown some strange problems, like auto-disconnecting from wifi and the light blinking from yellow to red. There are some instructions in the booklet, but I don't have the time to read them. I want peace of mind, which it gave me for a few months after installing it. Unfortunately, for the past few weeks, it has not been working flawlessly; sometimes the signal is so weak that it is not possible to view live camera from the Tapo mobile app. I don't know if it's a software issue or a weak wifi signal causing the problem. Otherwise, this is an excellent product at a very affordable price. Camera quality and build quality are top of the line.

    We should have a feature of non rotating if we dont want, sometimes rotating causes it to move to an angle which we dont want and also why cant it rotate without a noise, the noise catches attention

    I installed this camera 3 days ago. It is pretty light, easy to setup and has been working well so far. Notifications have very little delay and app works fine as well. I also installed the SDHC card in it today. App allows me to control the recording behavior - whether you want continuous recording or recording only on detections (which significantly optimizes the storage). It also loops so once the memory is full, it will start overwriting the old one.One significant flaw that prevented it from getting 5 star is that they upsell their subscription plan for even the rich notifications. Getting a thumbnail of the event or clip of video in notifications is very critical to quickly review and triage however in order to enable the rich thumbnail, they still want to you to sign up for the monthly or yearly plan. I am ok paying money if I want to use their cloud storage, but thumbnail / video clip could have been fully generated on the device and should have been offered without the forcing function of online storage.My other Google nest camera sends me rich notification without any subscription.

    it's a very good budget camera, only thing bothering me is the app gives instruction permission to only one useit should have feature where the main user can decide the level of excess to others

    Got it for 1800, but it certainly isn't worth it. The rotating feature is nice but the setup was very difficult. Ultimately had to replace and get another unit. New unit connected quickly but again there are many issues with it.The camera lags a LOT when the distance between wifi and camera is large. When near the wifi ~4 feet there is almost no lag. Which won't be practical most times.The wire is only 6.5ft (small) which makes it difficult to mount on the ceiling. And the app's UI is very bad. I use it on Ipad and it isn't adjusted accordingly meaning the UI is only compatible for phone.Overall I'd prefer the tapo with no rotation because it has better connectivity and UI.

    I really wanted to give it 5 stars. But for the past few weeks or months, I am not sure, it has shown some strange problems, like auto-disconnecting from wifi and the light blinking from yellow to red. There are some instructions in the booklet, but I don't have the time to read them. I want peace of mind, which it gave me for a few months after installing it. Unfortunately, for the past few weeks, it has not been working flawlessly; sometimes the signal is so weak that it is not possible to view live camera from the Tapo mobile app. I don't know if it's a software issue or a weak wifi signal causing the problem. Otherwise, this is an excellent product at a very affordable price. Camera quality and build quality are top of the line.

    We should have a feature of non rotating if we dont want, sometimes rotating causes it to move to an angle which we dont want and also why cant it rotate without a noise, the noise catches attention

    I installed this camera 3 days ago. It is pretty light, easy to setup and has been working well so far. Notifications have very little delay and app works fine as well. I also installed the SDHC card in it today. App allows me to control the recording behavior - whether you want continuous recording or recording only on detections (which significantly optimizes the storage). It also loops so once the memory is full, it will start overwriting the old one.One significant flaw that prevented it from getting 5 star is that they upsell their subscription plan for even the rich notifications. Getting a thumbnail of the event or clip of video in notifications is very critical to quickly review and triage however in order to enable the rich thumbnail, they still want to you to sign up for the monthly or yearly plan. I am ok paying money if I want to use their cloud storage, but thumbnail / video clip could have been fully generated on the device and should have been offered without the forcing function of online storage.My other Google nest camera sends me rich notification without any subscription.

    it's a very good budget camera, only thing bothering me is the app gives instruction permission to only one useit should have feature where the main user can decide the level of excess to others

    The printer does what is says -Pros:1) Print from anywhere (remotely) definitely a useful feature these days.2) wireless printing (on wifi) via laptop/mobile reduces dependency on one person at home to take printouts via laptop.3) wired printing via laptop.4) claims to print 12000 black and 6000 color pages. Probably coz you get two black re-fill bottles and one for each color. Page yield claim does seem to be correct cause I ended up printing approximately 40 pages only trying to set/configure it correctly and ink tank seems to be intact with no visible change in ink levels.5) print quality is great as well and you have option to chose from best/ draft and automatic option depending on the purpose of the printing.6) HP smart app is the key to use this prier and make use of all these features.Cons:1) Painful setup experience. If you don't follow the steps properly. It is really difficult to seti it up correctly and pair with HP smart app. Wasted 1 complete day to figure out how to set it up correctly once is messed up on initial setup. Not intuitive at all.2) No duplex printing on a printer over 15K price. That's a bit of disappointment. With a claim of 6000 pages yield per black refiller it is a no brainer people buying this would need auto duplex printing feature as well.Overall, good buy if you can live without auto duplex and ADF. You end up paying extra initially for the product but the running cost is a lot cheaper than the deskjet/inkjet printers.

    It's the most advanced printer for home/office usage to date in the market. I am finding the printer very friendly. Let's understand why it's better...- Easy installation, no expertise required (I watched some youtube unboxing videos)- Spill-proof ink filling makes it easier to refill ink tanks and it comes with old-school cartridges which are very easy to install as well.- Good printing quality, smart functions for an easy copy (B/W & Color) are very useful (direct copies from the scanner)- WiFi connectivity makes it a go-to printer for all connected devices (Phones, Laptops, PC, etc)What could have been better- I am finding it difficult to keep the printer away from dust, this printer could have been provided with a perfect fit cover keeping in mind the Indian household scenario.- Start-up time / Lead time is a bit on the higher side when given instructions to print. (it's because of various functions given and the printer runs the check to ensure every function is stable every time it wakes up)- The scanner cover could have been made adjustable, (scanning thick books is an issue)Nonetheless, this printer suits my need for a home printer and with a price point of 15K it serves the purpose well.

Eco mode need to be turned on from printer settings. Copying needs higher contrast levels to be set in settings for good prints.

    I personally feel the print quality is not good compared to Epson original ones. Consistency of ink itself seems different. Good to buy if u r ok to compromise slightly on quality as the original is almost double the cost of this.

    Fine prints one u get the settings right, scanning& copying is good enough, but double sided printing is USELESS.... paper jams on almost every 1-2 prints (using 70gsm), drives me mad to do it manually.Paper comes out curled due to heat.Although it isn't wifi but can print through mobile NokoPrint app using otg cable.Printed approx 100 pages, provided toner was at 80% on first install and still remains the same after prints. Eco mode need to be turned on from printer settings. Copying needs higher contrast levels to be set in settings for good prints.

    The printer does what is says -Pros:1) Print from anywhere (remotely) definitely a useful feature these days.2) wireless printing (on wifi) via laptop/mobile reduces dependency on one person at home to take printouts via laptop.3) wired printing via laptop.4) claims to print 12000 black and 6000 color pages. Probably coz you get two black re-fill bottles and one for each color. Page yield claim does seem to be correct cause I ended up printing approximately 40 pages only trying to set/configure it correctly and ink tank seems to be intact with no visible change in ink levels.5) print quality is great as well and you have option to chose from best/ draft and automatic option depending on the purpose of the printing.6) HP smart app is the key to use this prier and make use of all these features.Cons:1) Painful setup experience. If you don't follow the steps properly. It is really difficult to seti it up correctly and pair with HP smart app. Wasted 1 complete day to figure out how to set it up correctly once is messed up on initial setup. Not intuitive at all.2) No duplex printing on a printer over 15K price. That's a bit of disappointment. With a claim of 6000 pages yield per black refiller it is a no brainer people buying this would need auto duplex printing feature as well.Overall, good buy if you can live without auto duplex and ADF. You end up paying extra initially for the product but the running cost is a lot cheaper than the deskjet/inkjet printers.

    It's the most advanced printer for home/office usage to date in the market. I am finding the printer very friendly. Let's understand why it's better...- Easy installation, no expertise required (I watched some youtube unboxing videos)- Spill-proof ink filling makes it easier to refill ink tanks and it comes with old-school cartridges which are very easy to install as well.- Good printing quality, smart functions for an easy copy (B/W & Color) are very useful (direct copies from the scanner)- WiFi connectivity makes it a go-to printer for all connected devices (Phones, Laptops, PC, etc)What could have been better- I am finding it difficult to keep the printer away from dust, this printer could have been provided with a perfect fit cover keeping in mind the Indian household scenario.- Start-up time / Lead time is a bit on the higher side when given instructions to print. (it's because of various functions given and the printer runs the check to ensure every function is stable every time it wakes up)- The scanner cover could have been made adjustable, (scanning thick books is an issue)Nonetheless, this printer suits my need for a home printer and with a price point of 15K it serves the purpose well.

    I personally feel the print quality is not good compared to Epson original ones. Consistency of ink itself seems different. Good to buy if u r ok to compromise slightly on quality as the original is almost double the cost of this.

    Fine prints one u get the settings right, scanning& copying is good enough, but double sided printing is USELESS.... paper jams on almost every 1-2 prints (using 70gsm), drives me mad to do it manually.Paper comes out curled due to heat.Although it isn't wifi but can print through mobile NokoPrint app using otg cable.Printed approx 100 pages, provided toner was at 80% on first install and still remains the same after prints. Eco mode need to be turned on from printer settings. Copying needs higher contrast levels to be set in settings for good prints.

    Used this set to refill my Epson printer. Gives original like prints after settling down. Great value. No wastage.

    The printer does what is says -Pros:1) Print from anywhere (remotely) definitely a useful feature these days.2) wireless printing (on wifi) via laptop/mobile reduces dependency on one person at home to take printouts via laptop.3) wired printing via laptop.4) claims to print 12000 black and 6000 color pages. Probably coz you get two black re-fill bottles and one for each color. Page yield claim does seem to be correct cause I ended up printing approximately 40 pages only trying to set/configure it correctly and ink tank seems to be intact with no visible change in ink levels.5) print quality is great as well and you have option to chose from best/ draft and automatic option depending on the purpose of the printing.6) HP smart app is the key to use this prier and make use of all these features.Cons:1) Painful setup experience. If you don't follow the steps properly. It is really difficult to seti it up correctly and pair with HP smart app. Wasted 1 complete day to figure out how to set it up correctly once is messed up on initial setup. Not intuitive at all.2) No duplex printing on a printer over 15K price. That's a bit of disappointment. With a claim of 6000 pages yield per black refiller it is a no brainer people buying this would need auto duplex printing feature as well.Overall, good buy if you can live without auto duplex and ADF. You end up paying extra initially for the product but the running cost is a lot cheaper than the deskjet/inkjet printers.

    It's the most advanced printer for home/office usage to date in the market. I am finding the printer very friendly. Let's understand why it's better...- Easy installation, no expertise required (I watched some youtube unboxing videos)- Spill-proof ink filling makes it easier to refill ink tanks and it comes with old-school cartridges which are very easy to install as well.- Good printing quality, smart functions for an easy copy (B/W & Color) are very useful (direct copies from the scanner)- WiFi connectivity makes it a go-to printer for all connected devices (Phones, Laptops, PC, etc)What could have been better- I am finding it difficult to keep the printer away from dust, this printer could have been provided with a perfect fit cover keeping in mind the Indian household scenario.- Start-up time / Lead time is a bit on the higher side when given instructions to print. (it's because of various functions given and the printer runs the check to ensure every function is stable every time it wakes up)- The scanner cover could have been made adjustable, (scanning thick books is an issue)Nonetheless, this printer suits my need for a home printer and with a price point of 15K it serves the purpose well.

    Fine prints one u get the settings right, scanning& copying is good enough, but double sided printing is USELESS.... paper jams on almost every 1-2 prints (using 70gsm), drives me mad to do it manually.Paper comes out curled due to heat.Although it isn't wifi but can print through mobile NokoPrint app using otg cable.Printed approx 100 pages, provided toner was at 80% on first install and still remains the same after prints. Eco mode need to be turned on from printer settings. Copying needs higher contrast levels to be set in settings for good prints.

    I personally feel the print quality is not good compared to Epson original ones. Consistency of ink itself seems different. Good to buy if u r ok to compromise slightly on quality as the original is almost double the cost of this.

    Fine prints one u get the settings right, scanning& copying is good enough, but double sided printing is USELESS.... paper jams on almost every 1-2 prints (using 70gsm), drives me mad to do it manually.Paper comes out curled due to heat.Although it isn't wifi but can print through mobile NokoPrint app using otg cable.Printed approx 100 pages, provided toner was at 80% on first install and still remains the same after prints. Eco mode need to be turned on from printer settings. Copying needs higher contrast levels to be set in settings for good prints.

    I recently purchased a Flowlyf single monitor arm and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. The arm was easy to install and holds my monitor securely in place. It also has a sleek design that fits well with my desk setup. What impressed me the most was the added bonus of receiving complimentary coasters with my order. The coasters are high-quality and add a nice touch to my workspace. Overall, I highly recommend the Flowlyf single monitor arm and its accessories.

    The Soundbar has lived up to my expectations by giving amazing sound quality and clarity.I was in fact thinking multiple times for about a week as to whether pay a premium and go to established brands or to go for GoVo and make a substantial savings.But I'm glad now that I chose GoVo over others.In fact, for my bedroom, I already have a premium brand sound system for which I paid twice the price for half the wattage. But the GoVo Soundbar comes as a clear winner.Of course, I wished it came without the light works... It looked silly to me :-) But I can live with that...On the overall, full points to the GoVo design team!

    I recently purchased the GOVO SOUNDBAR, and it has exceeded all my expectations. The sound quality is excellent, with crystal-clear highs and deep, rich lows. The setup was a breeze, and the sleek design looks great in my living room. I also appreciate the multiple connectivity options, including Bluetooth, USB, and AUX, making it easy to connect to various devices. The remote control is a nice touch and allows me to adjust the volume and settings from across the room. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and highly recommend the GOVO SOUNDBAR to anyone in the market for a high-quality sound system.

I don't expect the result in this price range.I used it in My Office, When listening to music / movie, people pass by the office and wonder, ""That's great, where are the speakers?""Really awesome. Good Bass and Treble. Crisp, Clarity, Crystal Clear sound quality and Decent Volume. The most important thing is the Sound Quality and Loudness which is unmatchable in this price range, I would say it is a must buy product.I genuinely recommend this to everyone who is looking for a BASS LOVER in a huge budget.Thanks to GOVO Team.

Plus, it is much more affordable than buying a full set of speakers and a receiver.Overall, I would highly recommend this soundbar to anyone looking to improve their home entertainment system. It delivers exceptional sound quality, is easy to set up and use, and looks great in any room.

    I Purchased this unit some 10-12 days ago and here are my observationsWas excited initially but dis-appointed by knowing that 1000 pre loaded songs is a painful affair.Pros :1.Good Quality Sound (Not great)2.Wireless Mic are perfect3.1000 Pre-loaded songs4.Good Blue tooth connectivity.5. Good built quality.Cons :1.No search mechanism to select song and play, forward or reverse are the only option now think one wants to play song number 822 ?2.FM is not getting tuned easily requires much efforts. When all other devices in home are getting tuned perfectly , so there is a issue.3.Because con.1 mentioned above , you can not use 1000 preloaded songs as a KARAOKE track.So again for Karaoke you need to depend on YouTube or other options to play tracks.4.Very Loud announcements while On/Off and mode changing.5. Bass not that great considering a woofer size.5.Buttons which displays mode are on the top side of the bar hence not visible from eyelevel.

    Generally a good quality product.However, when buying the product I got an impression that the preloaded tracks are all karaoke enabled but realised that you need to have karaoke support from either YouTube or some other app. Reduced the rating because of this.

    The sound quality is ok not that great but who gives karoke with two wireless mics in 10k budget. The device got damaged within 3 months of purchase but it took almost a week to get it fixed. One good thing about this device is that service will be provided at home. No need to carry the device to service centre. For this reason only giving 5 stars.

    Very good product, sound quality is good. Loving the karaoke options and the mic's. It's best for someone to practice singing and get used to singing through mic. I brought it for my daughter and she is loving it. Thank you Caravan for yet another beautiful product. Pre-loaded old Hindi songs are a bonus on top of the product.

    I Purchased this unit some 10-12 days ago and here are my observationsWas excited initially but dis-appointed by knowing that 1000 pre loaded songs is a painful affair.Pros :1.Good Quality Sound (Not great)2.Wireless Mic are perfect3.1000 Pre-loaded songs4.Good Blue tooth connectivity.5. Good built quality.Cons :1.No search mechanism to select song and play, forward or reverse are the only option now think one wants to play song number 822 ?2.FM is not getting tuned easily requires much efforts. When all other devices in home are getting tuned perfectly , so there is a issue.3.Because con.1 mentioned above , you can not use 1000 preloaded songs as a KARAOKE track.So again for Karaoke you need to depend on YouTube or other options to play tracks.4.Very Loud announcements while On/Off and mode changing.5. Bass not that great considering a woofer size.5.Buttons which displays mode are on the top side of the bar hence not visible from eyelevel.

    The sound quality is ok not that great but who gives karoke with two wireless mics in 10k budget. The device got damaged within 3 months of purchase but it took almost a week to get it fixed. One good thing about this device is that service will be provided at home. No need to carry the device to service centre. For this reason only giving 5 stars.

    Remote Controller is extremely Rubbish and useless. It doesn't work unless I'm pointing it at speaker with exactly straight angle facing it and works only if move the remote closer enough to the soundbar within lesss than half a meter distance. Another problem with remote is the button to change source  ( Aux , BT , Coax , HDMI ) doesn't work intermittently  Even if it works , I have to try multiple times to just change the source , sometimes upto 20 times. I'm not sure whether the problem is with the unit I received or with the model itself. Extremely useless and terrible remote. It just defeats the purpose of having a remote controller in the first place.Sound quality is quite good. Slightly above average even though it doesn't support Dolby Atmos  for a budget soundbar like this , but it can't produce any kind of Surround Sound effects as promised in product description and advertising. Sound is just like Average Stereo Speakers without any surround sound or any effects which an external sub-woofer can produce. Wanted to provide 3.5 stars condering the efforts of designers , engineers and plant labourers invested in designing and manufacturing a budget friendly soundbar for masses. But Amazon doesn't allow half star hence providing 3 stars

    The Soundbar has lived up to my expectations by giving amazing sound quality and clarity.I was in fact thinking multiple times for about a week as to whether pay a premium and go to established brands or to go for GoVo and make a substantial savings.But I'm glad now that I chose GoVo over others.In fact, for my bedroom, I already have a premium brand sound system for which I paid twice the price for half the wattage. But the GoVo Soundbar comes as a clear winner.Of course, I wished it came without the light works... It looked silly to me :-) But I can live with that...On the overall, full points to the GoVo design team!

    I recently purchased the GOVO SOUNDBAR, and it has exceeded all my expectations. The sound quality is excellent, with crystal-clear highs and deep, rich lows. The setup was a breeze, and the sleek design looks great in my living room. I also appreciate the multiple connectivity options, including Bluetooth, USB, and AUX, making it easy to connect to various devices. The remote control is a nice touch and allows me to adjust the volume and settings from across the room. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and highly recommend the GOVO SOUNDBAR to anyone in the market for a high-quality sound system.

I don't expect the result in this price range.I used it in My Office, When listening to music / movie, people pass by the office and wonder, ""That's great, where are the speakers?""Really awesome. Good Bass and Treble. Crisp, Clarity, Crystal Clear sound quality and Decent Volume. The most important thing is the Sound Quality and Loudness which is unmatchable in this price range, I would say it is a must buy product.I genuinely recommend this to everyone who is looking for a BASS LOVER in a huge budget.Thanks to GOVO Team.

    a Govo soundbar for my home entertainment system, and I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase! The sound quality is amazing - I can now hear every detail in my favorite movies and TV shows.Not only is the sound quality excellent, but the setup process was also incredibly easy.Another great feature of this soundbar is its sleek and modern design. It looks great in my living room, and takes up much less space than a traditional home theater system. Plus, it is much more affordable than buying a full set of speakers and a receiver.Overall, I would highly recommend this soundbar to anyone looking to improve their home entertainment system. It delivers exceptional sound quality, is easy to set up and use, and looks great in any room.

    a Govo soundbar for my home entertainment system, and I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase! The sound quality is amazing - I can now hear every detail in my favorite movies and TV shows.Not only is the sound quality excellent, but the setup process was also incredibly easy.Another great feature of this soundbar is its sleek and modern design. It looks great in my living room, and takes up much less space than a traditional home theater system. Plus, it is much more affordable than buying a full set of speakers and a receiver.Overall, I would highly recommend this soundbar to anyone looking to improve their home entertainment system. It delivers exceptional sound quality, is easy to set up and use, and looks great in any room.

    Remote Controller is extremely Rubbish and useless. It doesn't work unless I'm pointing it at speaker with exactly straight angle facing it and works only if move the remote closer enough to the soundbar within lesss than half a meter distance. Another problem with remote is the button to change source  ( Aux , BT , Coax , HDMI ) doesn't work intermittently  Even if it works , I have to try multiple times to just change the source , sometimes upto 20 times. I'm not sure whether the problem is with the unit I received or with the model itself. Extremely useless and terrible remote. It just defeats the purpose of having a remote controller in the first place.Sound quality is quite good. Slightly above average even though it doesn't support Dolby Atmos  for a budget soundbar like this , but it can't produce any kind of Surround Sound effects as promised in product description and advertising.

    The Soundbar has lived up to my expectations by giving amazing sound quality and clarity.I was in fact thinking multiple times for about a week as to whether pay a premium and go to established brands or to go for GoVo and make a substantial savings.But I'm glad now that I chose GoVo over others.In fact, for my bedroom, I already have a premium brand sound system for which I paid twice the price for half the wattage. But the GoVo Soundbar comes as a clear winner.Of course, I wished it came without the light works... It looked silly to me :-) But I can live with that...On the overall, full points to the GoVo design team!

    I recently purchased the GOVO SOUNDBAR, and it has exceeded all my expectations. The sound quality is excellent, with crystal-clear highs and deep, rich lows. The setup was a breeze, and the sleek design looks great in my living room. I also appreciate the multiple connectivity options, including Bluetooth, USB, and AUX, making it easy to connect to various devices. The remote control is a nice touch and allows me to adjust the volume and settings from across the room. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and highly recommend the GOVO SOUNDBAR to anyone in the market for a high-quality sound system.

    Recently I purchased the GOVO GOSURROUND 900. Timely delivered it to me.Basically I'm a Music lover, I used more & more sound system in past 20 years. I don't expect the result in this price range.I used it in My Office, When listening to music / movie, people pass by the office and wonder, ""That's great, where are the speakers?""Really awesome. Good Bass and Treble. Crisp, Clarity, Crystal Clear sound quality and Decent Volume. The most important thing is the Sound Quality and Loudness which is unmatchable in this price range, I would say it is a must buy product.I genuinely recommend this to everyone who is looking for a BASS LOVER in a huge budget.Thanks to GOVO Team.

    Remote Controller is extremely Rubbish and useless. It doesn't work unless I'm pointing it at speaker with exactly straight angle facing it and works only if move the remote closer enough to the soundbar within lesss than half a meter distance. Another problem with remote is the button to change source  ( Aux , BT , Coax , HDMI ) doesn't work intermittently  Even if it works , I have to try multiple times to just change the source , sometimes upto 20 times. I'm not sure whether the problem is with the unit I received or with the model itself. Extremely useless and terrible remote. It just defeats the purpose of having a remote controller in the first place.Sound quality is quite good. Slightly above average even though it doesn't support Dolby Atmos  for a budget soundbar like this , but it can't produce any kind of Surround Sound effects as promised in product description and advertising. Sound is just like Average Stereo Speakers without any surround sound or any effects which an external sub-woofer can produce. Wanted to provide 3.5 stars condering the efforts of designers , engineers and plant labourers invested in designing and manufacturing a budget friendly soundbar for masses. But Amazon doesn't allow half star hence providing 3 stars

    The Soundbar has lived up to my expectations by giving amazing sound quality and clarity.I was in fact thinking multiple times for about a week as to whether pay a premium and go to established brands or to go for GoVo and make a substantial savings.But I'm glad now that I chose GoVo over others.In fact, for my bedroom, I already have a premium brand sound system for which I paid twice the price for half the wattage. But the GoVo Soundbar comes as a clear winner.Of course, I wished it came without the light works... It looked silly to me :-) But I can live with that...On the overall, full points to the GoVo design team!

    I recently purchased the GOVO SOUNDBAR, and it has exceeded all my expectations. The sound quality is excellent, with crystal-clear highs and deep, rich lows. The setup was a breeze, and the sleek design looks great in my living room. I also appreciate the multiple connectivity options, including Bluetooth, USB, and AUX, making it easy to connect to various devices. The remote control is a nice touch and allows me to adjust the volume and settings from across the room. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and highly recommend the GOVO SOUNDBAR to anyone in the market for a high-quality sound system.

    Recently I purchased the GOVO GOSURROUND 900. Timely delivered it to me.Basically I'm a Music lover, I used more & more sound system in past 20 years. I don't expect the result in this price range.I used it in My Office, When listening to music / movie, people pass by the office and wonder, ""That's great, where are the speakers?""Really awesome. Good Bass and Treble. Crisp, Clarity, Crystal Clear sound quality and Decent Volume. The most important thing is the Sound Quality and Loudness which is unmatchable in this price range, I would say it is a must buy product.I genuinely recommend this to everyone who is looking for a BASS LOVER in a huge budget.Thanks to GOVO Team. I give 5/5

    a Govo soundbar for my home entertainment system, and I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase! The sound quality is amazing - I can now hear every detail in my favorite movies and TV shows.Not only is the sound quality excellent, but the setup process was also incredibly easy.Another great feature of this soundbar is its sleek and modern design. It looks great in my living room, and takes up much less space than a traditional home theater system. Plus, it is much more affordable than buying a full set of speakers and a receiver.Overall, I would highly recommend this soundbar to anyone looking to improve their home entertainment system. It delivers exceptional sound quality, is easy to set up and use, and looks great in any room.

    The Soundbar has lived up to my expectations by giving amazing sound quality and clarity.I was in fact thinking multiple times for about a week as to whether pay a premium and go to established brands or to go for GoVo and make a substantial savings.But I'm glad now that I chose GoVo over others.In fact, for my bedroom, I already have a premium brand sound system for which I paid twice the price for half the wattage. But the GoVo Soundbar comes as a clear winner.Of course, I wished it came without the light works... It looked silly to me :-) But I can live with that...On the overall, full points to the GoVo design team!

    I recently purchased the GOVO SOUNDBAR, and it has exceeded all my expectations. The sound quality is excellent, with crystal-clear highs and deep, rich lows. The setup was a breeze, and the sleek design looks great in my living room. I also appreciate the multiple connectivity options, including Bluetooth, USB, and AUX, making it easy to connect to various devices. The remote control is a nice touch and allows me to adjust the volume and settings from across the room. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and highly recommend the GOVO SOUNDBAR to anyone in the market for a high-quality sound system.

    Recently I purchased the GOVO GOSURROUND 900. Timely delivered it to me.Basically I'm a Music lover, I used more & more sound system in past 20 years. I don't expect the result in this price range.I used it in My Office, When listening to music / movie, people pass by the office and wonder, ""That's great, where are the speakers?""Really awesome. Good Bass and Treble. Crisp, Clarity, Crystal Clear sound quality and Decent Volume. The most important thing is the Sound Quality and Loudness which is unmatchable in this price range, I would say it is a must buy product.I genuinely recommend this to everyone who is looking for a BASS LOVER in a huge budget.Thanks to GOVO Team.

    a Govo soundbar for my home entertainment system, and I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase! The sound quality is amazing - I can now hear every detail in my favorite movies and TV shows.Not only is the sound quality excellent, but the setup process was also incredibly easy.Another great feature of this soundbar is its sleek and modern design. It looks great in my living room, and takes up much less space than a traditional home theater system. Plus, it is much more affordable than buying a full set of speakers and a receiver.Overall, I would highly recommend this soundbar to anyone looking to improve their home entertainment system. It delivers exceptional sound quality, is easy to set up and use, and looks great in any room.

Good built quality.Cons :1.No search mechanism to select song and play, forward or reverse are the only option now think one wants to play song number 822 ?2.FM is not getting tuned easily requires much efforts. When all other devices in home are getting tuned perfectly , so there is a issue.3.Because con.1 mentioned above , you can not use 1000 preloaded songs as a KARAOKE track.So again for Karaoke you need to depend on YouTube or other options to play tracks.4.Very Loud announcements while On/Off and mode changing.5. Bass not that great considering a woofer size.5.Buttons which displays mode are on the top side of the bar hence not visible from eyelevel.

    Remote Controller is extremely Rubbish and useless. It doesn't work unless I'm pointing it at speaker with exactly straight angle facing it and works only if move the remote closer enough to the soundbar within lesss than half a meter distance. Another problem with remote is the button to change source  ( Aux , BT , Coax , HDMI ) doesn't work intermittently  Even if it works , I have to try multiple times to just change the source , sometimes upto 20 times. I'm not sure whether the problem is with the unit I received or with the model itself. Extremely useless and terrible remote. It just defeats the purpose of having a remote controller in the first place.Sound quality is quite good. Slightly above average even though it doesn't support Dolby Atmos  for a budget soundbar like this , but it can't produce any kind of Surround Sound effects as promised in product description and advertising. Sound is just like Average Stereo Speakers without any surround sound or any effects which an external sub-woofer can produce. Wanted to provide 3.5 stars condering the efforts of designers , engineers and plant labourers invested in designing and manufacturing a budget friendly soundbar for masses. But Amazon doesn't allow half star hence providing 3 stars

Wanted to provide 3.5 stars condering the efforts of designers , engineers and plant labourers invested in designing and manufacturing a budget friendly soundbar for masses. But Amazon doesn't allow half star hence providing 3 stars

Good built quality.Cons :1.No search mechanism to select song and play, forward or reverse are the only option now think one wants to play song number 822 ?2.FM is not getting tuned easily requires much efforts. When all other devices in home are getting tuned perfectly , so there is a issue.3.Because con.1 mentioned above , you can not use 1000 preloaded songs as a KARAOKE track.So again for Karaoke you need to depend on YouTube or other options to play tracks.4.Very Loud announcements while On/Off and mode changing.5. Bass not that great considering a woofer size.5.Buttons which displays mode are on the top side of the bar hence not visible from eyelevel.

    The Soundbar has lived up to my expectations by giving amazing sound quality and clarity.I was in fact thinking multiple times for about a week as to whether pay a premium and go to established brands or to go for GoVo and make a substantial savings.But I'm glad now that I chose GoVo over others.In fact, for my bedroom, I already have a premium brand sound system for which I paid twice the price for half the wattage. But the GoVo Soundbar comes as a clear winner.Of course, I wished it came without the light works... It looked silly to me :-) But I can live with that...On the overall, full points to the GoVo design team!

    I recently purchased the GOVO SOUNDBAR, and it has exceeded all my expectations. The sound quality is excellent, with crystal-clear highs and deep, rich lows. The setup was a breeze, and the sleek design looks great in my living room. I also appreciate the multiple connectivity options, including Bluetooth, USB, and AUX, making it easy to connect to various devices. The remote control is a nice touch and allows me to adjust the volume and settings from across the room. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and highly recommend the GOVO SOUNDBAR to anyone in the market for a high-quality sound system.

I don't expect the result in this price range.I used it in My Office, When listening to music / movie, people pass by the office and wonder, ""That's great, where are the speakers?""Really awesome. Good Bass and Treble. Crisp, Clarity, Crystal Clear sound quality and Decent Volume. The most important thing is the Sound Quality and Loudness which is unmatchable in this price range, I would say it is a must buy product.I genuinely recommend this to everyone who is looking for a BASS LOVER in a huge budget.Thanks to GOVO Team.

    a Govo soundbar for my home entertainment system, and I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase! The sound quality is amazing - I can now hear every detail in my favorite movies and TV shows.Not only is the sound quality excellent, but the setup process was also incredibly easy.Another great feature of this soundbar is its sleek and modern design. It looks great in my living room, and takes up much less space than a traditional home theater system. Plus, it is much more affordable than buying a full set of speakers and a receiver.Overall, I would highly recommend this soundbar to anyone looking to improve their home entertainment system. It delivers exceptional sound quality, is easy to set up and use, and looks great in any room.

    Remote Controller is extremely Rubbish and useless. It doesn't work unless I'm pointing it at speaker with exactly straight angle facing it and works only if move the remote closer enough to the soundbar within lesss than half a meter distance. Another problem with remote is the button to change source  ( Aux , BT , Coax , HDMI ) doesn't work intermittently  Even if it works , I have to try multiple times to just change the source , sometimes upto 20 times. I'm not sure whether the problem is with the unit I received or with the model itself. Extremely useless and terrible remote. It just defeats the purpose of having a remote controller in the first place.Sound quality is quite good. Slightly above average even though it doesn't support Dolby Atmos  for a budget soundbar like this , but it can't produce any kind of Surround Sound effects as promised in product description and advertising. Sound is just like Average Stereo Speakers without any surround sound or any effects which an external sub-woofer can produce.

It just defeats the purpose of having a remote controller in the first place.Sound quality is quite good. Slightly above average even though it doesn't support Dolby Atmos  for a budget soundbar like this , but it can't produce any kind of Surround Sound effects as promised in product description and advertising. Sound is just like Average Stereo Speakers without any surround sound or any effects which an external sub-woofer can produce. Wanted to provide 3.5 stars condering the efforts of designers , engineers and plant labourers invested in designing and manufacturing a budget friendly soundbar for masses. But Amazon doesn't allow half star hence providing 3 stars

    Recently I purchased the GOVO GOSURROUND 900. Timely delivered it to me.Basically I'm a Music lover, I used more & more sound system in past 20 years. I don't expect the result in this price range.I used it in My Office, When listening to music / movie, people pass by the office and wonder, ""That's great, where are the speakers?""Really awesome. Good Bass and Treble. Crisp, Clarity, Crystal Clear sound quality and Decent Volume. The most important thing is the Sound Quality and Loudness which is unmatchable in this price range, I would say it is a must buy product.I genuinely recommend this to everyone who is looking for a BASS LOVER in a huge budget.Thanks to GOVO Team.

    a Govo soundbar for my home entertainment system, and I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase! The sound quality is amazing - I can now hear every detail in my favorite movies and TV shows.Not only is the sound quality excellent, but the setup process was also incredibly easy.Another great feature of this soundbar is its sleek and modern design. It looks great in my living room, and takes up much less space than a traditional home theater system. Plus, it is much more affordable than buying a full set of speakers and a receiver.Overall, I would highly recommend this soundbar to anyone looking to improve their home entertainment system. It delivers exceptional sound quality, is easy to set up and use, and looks great in any room.

    a Govo soundbar for my home entertainment system, and I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase! The sound quality is amazing - I can now hear every detail in my favorite movies and TV shows.Not only is the sound quality excellent, but the setup process was also incredibly easy.Another great feature of this soundbar is its sleek and modern design. It looks great in my living room, and takes up much less space than a traditional home theater system. Plus, it is much more affordable than buying a full set of speakers and a receiver.Overall, I would highly recommend this soundbar to anyone looking to improve their home entertainment system.

    The Soundbar has lived up to my expectations by giving amazing sound quality and clarity.I was in fact thinking multiple times for about a week as to whether pay a premium and go to established brands or to go for GoVo and make a substantial savings.But I'm glad now that I chose GoVo over others.In fact, for my bedroom, I already have a premium brand sound system for which I paid twice the price for half the wattage. But the GoVo Soundbar comes as a clear winner.Of course, I wished it came without the light works... It looked silly to me :-) But I can live with that...On the overall, full points to the GoVo design team!

    Remote Controller is extremely Rubbish and useless. It doesn't work unless I'm pointing it at speaker with exactly straight angle facing it and works only if move the remote closer enough to the soundbar within lesss than half a meter distance. Another problem with remote is the button to change source  ( Aux , BT , Coax , HDMI ) doesn't work intermittently  Even if it works , I have to try multiple times to just change the source , sometimes upto 20 times. I'm not sure whether the problem is with the unit I received or with the model itself. Extremely useless and terrible remote. It just defeats the purpose of having a remote controller in the first place.Sound quality is quite good. Slightly above average even though it doesn't support Dolby Atmos  for a budget soundbar like this , but it can't produce any kind of Surround Sound effects as promised in product description and advertising. Sound is just like Average Stereo Speakers without any surround sound or any effects which an external sub-woofer can produce. Wanted to provide 3.5 stars condering the efforts of designers , engineers and plant labourers invested in designing and manufacturing a budget friendly soundbar for masses. But Amazon doesn't allow half star hence providing 3 stars

But the GoVo Soundbar comes as a clear winner.Of course, I wished it came without the light works... It looked silly to me :-) But I can live with that...On the overall, full points to the GoVo design team!

    I recently purchased the GOVO SOUNDBAR, and it has exceeded all my expectations. The sound quality is excellent, with crystal-clear highs and deep, rich lows. The setup was a breeze, and the sleek design looks great in my living room. I also appreciate the multiple connectivity options, including Bluetooth, USB, and AUX, making it easy to connect to various devices. The remote control is a nice touch and allows me to adjust the volume and settings from across the room. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and highly recommend the GOVO SOUNDBAR to anyone in the market for a high-quality sound system.

    Recently I purchased the GOVO GOSURROUND 900. Timely delivered it to me.Basically I'm a Music lover, I used more & more sound system in past 20 years. I don't expect the result in this price range.I used it in My Office, When listening to music / movie, people pass by the office and wonder, ""That's great, where are the speakers?""Really awesome. Good Bass and Treble. Crisp, Clarity, Crystal Clear sound quality and Decent Volume. The most important thing is the Sound Quality and Loudness which is unmatchable in this price range, I would say it is a must buy product.I genuinely recommend this to everyone who is looking for a BASS LOVER in a huge budget.Thanks to GOVO Team. I give 5/5

    a Govo soundbar for my home entertainment system, and I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase! The sound quality is amazing - I can now hear every detail in my favorite movies and TV shows.Not only is the sound quality excellent, but the setup process was also incredibly easy.Another great feature of this soundbar is its sleek and modern design. It looks great in my living room, and takes up much less space than a traditional home theater system. Plus, it is much more affordable than buying a full set of speakers and a receiver.Overall, I would highly recommend this soundbar to anyone looking to improve their home entertainment system. It delivers exceptional sound quality, is easy to set up and use, and looks great in any room.

    Overall it is a great product. There is a little bit of latency in Bluetooth connection. But I have used it with hdmi (arc) connection thus getting excellent quality audio. It also looks great.

    I Purchased this unit some 10-12 days ago and here are my observationsWas excited initially but dis-appointed by knowing that 1000 pre loaded songs is a painful affair.Pros :1.Good Quality Sound (Not great)2.Wireless Mic are perfect3.1000 Pre-loaded songs4.Good Blue tooth connectivity.5. Good built quality.Cons :1.No search mechanism to select song and play, forward or reverse are the only option now think one wants to play song number 822 ?2.FM is not getting tuned easily requires much efforts. When all other devices in home are getting tuned perfectly , so there is a issue.3.Because con.1 mentioned above , you can not use 1000 preloaded songs as a KARAOKE track.So again for Karaoke you need to depend on YouTube or other options to play tracks.4.Very Loud announcements while On/Off and mode changing.5. Bass not that great considering a woofer size.5.Buttons which displays mode are on the top side of the bar hence not visible from eyelevel.

    Remote Controller is extremely Rubbish and useless. It doesn't work unless I'm pointing it at speaker with exactly straight angle facing it and works only if move the remote closer enough to the soundbar within lesss than half a meter distance. Another problem with remote is the button to change source  ( Aux , BT , Coax , HDMI ) doesn't work intermittently  Even if it works , I have to try multiple times to just change the source , sometimes upto 20 times. I'm not sure whether the problem is with the unit I received or with the model itself. Extremely useless and terrible remote. It just defeats the purpose of having a remote controller in the first place.Sound quality is quite good. Slightly above average even though it doesn't support Dolby Atmos  for a budget soundbar like this , but it can't produce any kind of Surround Sound effects as promised in product description and advertising. Sound is just like Average Stereo Speakers without any surround sound or any effects which an external sub-woofer can produce. Wanted to provide 3.5 stars condering the efforts of designers , engineers and plant labourers invested in designing and manufacturing a budget friendly soundbar for masses. But Amazon doesn't allow half star hence providing 3 stars

    Remote Controller is extremely Rubbish and useless. It doesn't work unless I'm pointing it at speaker with exactly straight angle facing it and works only if move the remote closer enough to the soundbar within lesss than half a meter distance. Another problem with remote is the button to change source  ( Aux , BT , Coax , HDMI ) doesn't work intermittently  Even if it works , I have to try multiple times to just change the source , sometimes upto 20 times. I'm not sure whether the problem is with the unit I received or with the model itself. Extremely useless and terrible remote. It just defeats the purpose of having a remote controller in the first place.Sound quality is quite good. Slightly above average even though it doesn't support Dolby Atmos  for a budget soundbar like this , but it can't produce any kind of Surround Sound effects as promised in product description and advertising. Sound is just like Average Stereo Speakers without any surround sound or any effects which an external sub-woofer can produce. Wanted to provide 3.5 stars condering the efforts of designers , engineers and plant labourers invested in designing and manufacturing a budget friendly soundbar for masses. But Amazon doesn't allow half star hence providing 3 stars

    Overall it is a great product. There is a little bit of latency in Bluetooth connection. But I have used it with hdmi (arc) connection thus getting excellent quality audio. It also looks great.

    The Soundbar has lived up to my expectations by giving amazing sound quality and clarity.I was in fact thinking multiple times for about a week as to whether pay a premium and go to established brands or to go for GoVo and make a substantial savings.But I'm glad now that I chose GoVo over others.In fact, for my bedroom, I already have a premium brand sound system for which I paid twice the price for half the wattage. But the GoVo Soundbar comes as a clear winner.Of course, I wished it came without the light works... It looked silly to me :-) But I can live with that...On the overall, full points to the GoVo design team!

    I recently purchased the GOVO SOUNDBAR, and it has exceeded all my expectations. The sound quality is excellent, with crystal-clear highs and deep, rich lows. The setup was a breeze, and the sleek design looks great in my living room. I also appreciate the multiple connectivity options, including Bluetooth, USB, and AUX, making it easy to connect to various devices. The remote control is a nice touch and allows me to adjust the volume and settings from across the room. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and highly recommend the GOVO SOUNDBAR to anyone in the market for a high-quality sound system.

    Recently I purchased the GOVO GOSURROUND 900. Timely delivered it to me.Basically I'm a Music lover, I used more & more sound system in past 20 years. I don't expect the result in this price range.I used it in My Office, When listening to music / movie, people pass by the office and wonder, ""That's great, where are the speakers?""Really awesome. Good Bass and Treble. Crisp, Clarity, Crystal Clear sound quality and Decent Volume. The most important thing is the Sound Quality and Loudness which is unmatchable in this price range, I would say it is a must buy product.I genuinely recommend this to everyone who is looking for a BASS LOVER in a huge budget.Thanks to GOVO Team. I give 5/5

    a Govo soundbar for my home entertainment system, and I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase! The sound quality is amazing - I can now hear every detail in my favorite movies and TV shows.Not only is the sound quality excellent, but the setup process was also incredibly easy.Another great feature of this soundbar is its sleek and modern design. It looks great in my living room, and takes up much less space than a traditional home theater system. Plus, it is much more affordable than buying a full set of speakers and a receiver.Overall, I would highly recommend this soundbar to anyone looking to improve their home entertainment system. It delivers exceptional sound quality, is easy to set up and use, and looks great in any room.

    Remote Controller is extremely Rubbish and useless. It doesn't work unless I'm pointing it at speaker with exactly straight angle facing it and works only if move the remote closer enough to the soundbar within lesss than half a meter distance. Another problem with remote is the button to change source  ( Aux , BT , Coax , HDMI ) doesn't work intermittently  Even if it works , I have to try multiple times to just change the source , sometimes upto 20 times. I'm not sure whether the problem is with the unit I received or with the model itself. Extremely useless and terrible remote. It just defeats the purpose of having a remote controller in the first place.Sound quality is quite good. Slightly above average even though it doesn't support Dolby Atmos  for a budget soundbar like this , but it can't produce any kind of Surround Sound effects as promised in product description and advertising. Sound is just like Average Stereo Speakers without any surround sound or any effects which an external sub-woofer can produce. Wanted to provide 3.5 stars condering the efforts of designers , engineers and plant labourers invested in designing and manufacturing a budget friendly soundbar for masses. But Amazon doesn't allow half star hence providing 3 stars

    Update - Returning this, worked well for a while but giving random issues which are as below:* First one was randomly disocnnection and / or rebooting, replaced and got a fresh piece.* Fresh piece didnt have issues of disconnection but the speeds I get are low.* My connection is 400mbps but max this router reached was 300mbps. Thought it to be an issue with ISP , complained but was checked with their device and speeds were as much as 380-390mbps on a 400mbps connection* Even on 2.4Ghz signal range was ok but max speed attained even sitting besides the router was just 75-80mbps max, no setting nothing made it reach more than that. Once it reached 135mbps but that was about it.CONCLUSION: Requested to return this, probably this router still has some software / hardware issues which I am not willing to deal with anymore. Specs on paper are extemely good for the given price point but product fails to delivers in real world. Most of the AI features are just gimmick, doesnt work in real life.For those confused by Negative Reviews and don't know whether to buy. Has been in a same situation before I bought. Router has no issues at all in anything. Following are the common complaints that all the people mentioned:1. Low download speeds2. High ping rates3. Rebooting issues4. Heating issuesMy experience initially:Got it in evening, called my ISP for I'd password and got MAC reset done by then so I can get new router connected. Setup through phone using Eagle Pro App, took hardly 10 minutes coz app is a bit buggy.Then comes the hard part. Speed on wifi is 20 Mbps, on a 300 Mbps connection, I am shocked to see it. Look at the router login and see the firmware version.Remedy: Router had firmware version as 1.4.4, due to my previous experience I knew that updating firmware to latest would most likely resolve the issues. So I search ""D-Link R15 Firmware"" in Google and first link has all the zip files. Download latest version i.e. 1.6.10. Extract the zip and you would get a bin file.Now go to router interface in system, Management and then to upgrade, click on advanced, select bin file and update. Would take few minutes and you have latest firmware. Now just to be sure, I reset the router to factory defaults by using reset button at back of router.It restarts and I do the configuration again. And now that I connect it to my ISP ont device I get close to 300 Mbps speed everytime.Nutshell: Update the firmware and you will get all that the specifications of this router promise.Haven't found any issues since 2 days, will update if I find any.Wanted to help those who are lured by Wifi 6 at such a reasonable price but are afraid that it might not work. So I am giving complete process here so no one holds back on buying this going by Negative Reviews. It's bang for the buck.

    I received this router last week which is also known as AX50. I was overexcited of getting WiFi 6 router. I overlooked some review on amazon about how it heats up when placed on flat surface and ordered myself as I needed a gigabyte router and thought to invest in the new technology. So far I can summarize some of the issues I came across on this router (I have around 10 Tp-link routers at this point, from cheapest to N to dual band.)1. It does heat up considerably from top and bottom middle portion. If I have to keep this router and no firmware can fix this, you have to install a PC cabinet fan under it to help remove the heat.2. This router doesn't provide Bridging/WDS functionality that all other routers that I have from tp-link has. Very disappointed as this functionality is present even in the least expensive tp-link router.3. The range of 2.4 GHz is no better than cheapest tp-link single band dual antenna that cost around 1000 rs has so disappointed with 2.4GHz WiFi performance.4. 5 GHz band is as usual have short range. The 5 GHz AC can connect to any device with a maximum of 1200 Mbps link speed, even if supported WiFi adapter maximum speed is higher to 1200mbps. If only AX mode is selected, router can connect to AX device to maximum of 2400 Mbps but it will not run AC mode. With mix mode with AC and AX, the maximum connection speed reduces to 1200 Mbps even for AX devices. So, this router is called AX router with 2400 Mbps for 5GHz or a AX router with 1200 Mbps that can connect to AC devices too, so it is misleading on part of TP-link. I shared the same on their forum but no response from their representative.5. Channel numbers for each band seems to change from those set in the admin configuration page after few session so if any bridge router connected to this AX router, it will disconnect.6. Ethernet Gigabit ports is maxing out at around 750 mbps read and 350 mbps write speed. I used CAT 7 cable to test the speed in my internal network. With a gigabit switch, I can get around 900mbps read and 600mbps write. Disappointed here too.7. AC wifi is maxing out at 22 MBps and 45 MBps in the internal network test. This is disappointing result as this results is what I can get with older tp-link C5 router.8. With Intel AX200NGW wifi 6 160 MHz adapter, I could connect to the router with 2400 Gbps connection.9. This router doesn't support tp-link OneMesh functionality which allow to connect other router to form a internet mesh to avoid wifi deadspots in home or office.For configurations, I have disabled Airtime Fairness and OFDMA. I have enabled MU-MIMO as my laptop Killer's wifi adapter 1550i supports it. Smart connect is disconnected. One ethernet and 2 wlan devices are connected to the router. AX functionality is not yet tested as I still have to install Intel's wifi 6 AX200NGW adapter to my laptop.  Router is running on new firmware as mentioned in the details.I did some test to get AX performance of the router.

    I received this router last week which is also known as AX50. I was overexcited of getting WiFi 6 router. I overlooked some review on amazon about how it heats up when placed on flat surface and ordered myself as I needed a gigabyte router and thought to invest in the new technology. So far I can summarize some of the issues I came across on this router (I have around 10 Tp-link routers at this point, from cheapest to N to dual band.)1. It does heat up considerably from top and bottom middle portion. If I have to keep this router and no firmware can fix this, you have to install a PC cabinet fan under it to help remove the heat.2. This router doesn't provide Bridging/WDS functionality that all other routers that I have from tp-link has. Very disappointed as this functionality is present even in the least expensive tp-link router.3. The range of 2.4 GHz is no better than cheapest tp-link single band dual antenna that cost around 1000 rs has so disappointed with 2.4GHz WiFi performance.4. 5 GHz band is as usual have short range. The 5 GHz AC can connect to any device with a maximum of 1200 Mbps link speed, even if supported WiFi adapter maximum speed is higher to 1200mbps. If only AX mode is selected, router can connect to AX device to maximum of 2400 Mbps but it will not run AC mode. With mix mode with AC and AX, the maximum connection speed reduces to 1200 Mbps even for AX devices. So, this router is called AX router with 2400 Mbps for 5GHz or a AX router with 1200 Mbps that can connect to AC devices too, so it is misleading on part of TP-link. I shared the same on their forum but no response from their representative.5. Channel numbers for each band seems to change from those set in the admin configuration page after few session so if any bridge router connected to this AX router, it will disconnect.6. Ethernet Gigabit ports is maxing out at around 750 mbps read and 350 mbps write speed. I used CAT 7 cable to test the speed in my internal network. With a gigabit switch, I can get around 900mbps read and 600mbps write. Disappointed here too.7. AC wifi is maxing out at 22 MBps and 45 MBps in the internal network test. This is disappointing result as this results is what I can get with older tp-link C5 router.8. With Intel AX200NGW wifi 6 160 MHz adapter, I could connect to the router with 2400 Gbps connection.9. This router doesn't support tp-link OneMesh functionality which allow to connect other router to form a internet mesh to avoid wifi deadspots in home or office.For configurations, I have disabled Airtime Fairness and OFDMA. I have enabled MU-MIMO as my laptop Killer's wifi adapter 1550i supports it. Smart connect is disconnected. One ethernet and 2 wlan devices are connected to the router. AX functionality is not yet tested as I still have to install Intel's wifi 6 AX200NGW adapter to my laptop.  Router is running on new firmware as mentioned in the details.I did some test to get AX performance of the router. I enabled OFDMA, from 20 MHz till 160 MHz and MU MIMO functions for 5 GHz band and did all test with wifi router 1feet from the laptop equipped with Intel AX200NGW 160MHz wifi adapter. The test was done using Synology Diskstation connected to the router Gigabit port.

    It works fine for me. Connect with 100mbps connection and got almost 100 Mbps through wifi . I think the firmwire updations fixed the privious issues . AI assistant Weekly report was nice.i'm using it in a close distance so no range issue for me .The Ai app works fine ,it's easy to configure and easy access from anywhere. Wifi 6 connection also good .I think it's a good entry level wifi 6 router . no random restart for me . Not sure about long distance performance, i got full coverage in my small home and connected 5 devices constantly almost all time. Firmwire updations are also easy through app. üëç

    Update - Returning this, worked well for a while but giving random issues which are as below:* First one was randomly disocnnection and / or rebooting, replaced and got a fresh piece.* Fresh piece didnt have issues of disconnection but the speeds I get are low.* My connection is 400mbps but max this router reached was 300mbps. Thought it to be an issue with ISP , complained but was checked with their device and speeds were as much as 380-390mbps on a 400mbps connection* Even on 2.4Ghz signal range was ok but max speed attained even sitting besides the router was just 75-80mbps max, no setting nothing made it reach more than that. Once it reached 135mbps but that was about it.CONCLUSION: Requested to return this, probably this router still has some software / hardware issues which I am not willing to deal with anymore. Specs on paper are extemely good for the given price point but product fails to delivers in real world. Most of the AI features are just gimmick, doesnt work in real life.For those confused by Negative Reviews and don't know whether to buy. Has been in a same situation before I bought. Router has no issues at all in anything. Following are the common complaints that all the people mentioned:1. Low download speeds2. High ping rates3. Rebooting issues4. Heating issuesMy experience initially:Got it in evening, called my ISP for I'd password and got MAC reset done by then so I can get new router connected. Setup through phone using Eagle Pro App, took hardly 10 minutes coz app is a bit buggy.Then comes the hard part. Speed on wifi is 20 Mbps, on a 300 Mbps connection, I am shocked to see it. Look at the router login and see the firmware version.Remedy: Router had firmware version as 1.4.4, due to my previous experience I knew that updating firmware to latest would most likely resolve the issues. So I search ""D-Link R15 Firmware"" in Google and first link has all the zip files. Download latest version i.e. 1.6.10. Extract the zip and you would get a bin file.Now go to router interface in system, Management and then to upgrade, click on advanced, select bin file and update. Would take few minutes and you have latest firmware. Now just to be sure, I reset the router to factory defaults by using reset button at back of router.It restarts and I do the configuration again. And now that I connect it to my ISP ont device I get close to 300 Mbps speed everytime.Nutshell: Update the firmware and you will get all that the specifications of this router promise.Haven't found any issues since 2 days, will update if I find any.Wanted to help those who are lured by Wifi 6 at such a reasonable price but are afraid that it might not work. So I am giving complete process here so no one holds back on buying this going by Negative Reviews. It's bang for the buck.

Even though there were two antennas, the Wi-Fi range was hella low! I was hoping to avoid using a repeater, but I had to bust it out just to get the 2.4Ghz speed to reach the upper floors! And get this, even though the 5Ghz speed was pretty good, it didn't even make it to the upper floor! WTF, man?!

With a gigabit switch, I can get around 900mbps read and 600mbps write. Disappointed here too.7. AC wifi is maxing out at 22 MBps and 45 MBps in the internal network test. This is disappointing result as this results is what I can get with older tp-link C5 router.8. With Intel AX200NGW wifi 6 160 MHz adapter, I could connect to the router with 2400 Gbps connection.9. This router doesn't support tp-link OneMesh functionality which allow to connect other router to form a internet mesh to avoid wifi deadspots in home or office.For configurations, I have disabled Airtime Fairness and OFDMA. I have enabled MU-MIMO as my laptop Killer's wifi adapter 1550i supports it. Smart connect is disconnected. One ethernet and 2 wlan devices are connected to the router. AX functionality is not yet tested as I still have to install Intel's wifi 6 AX200NGW adapter to my laptop.  Router is running on new firmware as mentioned in the details.I did some test to get AX performance of the router. I enabled OFDMA, from 20 MHz till 160 MHz and MU MIMO functions for 5 GHz band and did all test with wifi router 1feet from the laptop equipped with Intel AX200NGW 160MHz wifi adapter. The test was done using Synology Diskstation connected to the router Gigabit port. Diskstation is capable of read and write of over 800 Mbps.Channel number 120 (DFS) Below is the test results:20MHz - Writing 98.33 Mbps reading 166.51 Mbps - laptop achieved connection with link speed of 287 Mbps40MHz - Writing 125 Mbps reading 250 Mbps - laptop achieved connection with link speed of 574 Mbps80MHz - Writing 180 Mbps reading 350 Mbps - laptop achieved connection with link speed of 1200 Mbps160MHz - Writing 165 Mbps reading 370 Mbps - laptop achieved connection with link speed of 1200 Mbps160MHz  - Writing 190 Mbps reading 400 Mbps - laptop achieved connection with link speed of 2400 MbpsFurther I tested the USB 3.0 speed by connecting a Lexar Triton USB 3 with maximum speed 170 read and 170 write speed. I got no more than 15 MBps in write and 25 MBps in read when router was connected with 2400 Mbps speed. The result of these transfer is again disappointing .Other star attraction feature of QoS and parental control won't work if you have no tp-link id and internet connection. For this id, you have to give personal information and potential risk of direct connection of this router to some Chinese company which, if they want, they can access all of your devices connected to this router.In view of my observations since last 2 days and several test as mentioned above, I believe that this router is not worth the money spend.Bridging/WDS function removed and AX band and USB 3 actual transfer rate as well as 2.4 GHz range are mediocre at best. Heat generation is another big issue to the longevity of the device.

    -you might need to read this if u having 2.4ghz range issue : ""when i had first time setup this router,i was getting very less 2.4ghz range,signal in other room,i was not very happy with that so i did this- i updated the router's firmware manually(downloaded from tp link site) after that i reset the router,then when setting it up,in wireless setting do not disable smart connect feature or else you will have trouble with range even if you only want to use 2.4 ghz,i heard this limits speed to 100mbps but this was the only way by which i got more range else i was getting like 1-2 mbps but now its 20-28 mbps big difference.""-build quality is ok-interface is ok-note-router's inbuilt automatic firmware upgrade doesnt work well as it didnt chose to update last updated firmware,choosed older one.i had to manually update it. version which was delivered is v1.0 older one(kind of disappointed from this but router works and thats what i need)-Even some of the features that other cheap tp link routers offer are missing such as wds bridge,3rd party vpn support-i dont think,router has heating coz its normal for routers to get hot such as my modem+router combo which goes upto 65 degree in summer still doesnt restart or disconnect.this one doesnt have feature to see temperature from interface so cant say anything about heating issue in router-(Please Use Your Modem in Bridge Mode and Then Connect this one or you might not get full out of this router and will experience double-nat type issue.)-i bought this router because my isp just blocked my router's admin access via firmware update and they are not providing credentials now i just cant do anything to its wireless settings or lan settings so i bought this routerwill update this review in june if it overheats or if i face any issue,currently it is working ok with my zte f660 modem being on bridge mode.

    Yo, I was so hyped to try out this TP-Link Wi-Fi router, and the packaging looked dope AF! But lemme tell you, the actual performance was not lit, fam! Even though there were two antennas, the Wi-Fi range was hella low! I was hoping to avoid using a repeater, but I had to bust it out just to get the 2.4Ghz speed to reach the upper floors! And get this, even though the 5Ghz speed was pretty good, it didn't even make it to the upper floor! WTF, man?! Plus, the product had some bugs, including the occasional ""no internet"" message, which was a total buzzkill, ya know? If you're on the hunt for a new router, I'd recommend looking for non-Chinese options for better quality, dude. All in all, the packaging was sick, but the actual product performance was whack!

    It works fine for me. Connect with 100mbps connection and got almost 100 Mbps through wifi . I think the firmwire updations fixed the privious issues . AI assistant Weekly report was nice.i'm using it in a close distance so no range issue for me .The Ai app works fine ,it's easy to configure and easy access from anywhere. Wifi 6 connection also good .I think it's a good entry level wifi 6 router . no random restart for me . Not sure about long distance performance, i got full coverage in my small home and connected 5 devices constantly almost all time. Firmwire updations are also easy through app. üëç

    Update - Returning this, worked well for a while but giving random issues which are as below:* First one was randomly disocnnection and / or rebooting, replaced and got a fresh piece.* Fresh piece didnt have issues of disconnection but the speeds I get are low.* My connection is 400mbps but max this router reached was 300mbps. Thought it to be an issue with ISP , complained but was checked with their device and speeds were as much as 380-390mbps on a 400mbps connection* Even on 2.4Ghz signal range was ok but max speed attained even sitting besides the router was just 75-80mbps max, no setting nothing made it reach more than that. Once it reached 135mbps but that was about it.CONCLUSION: Requested to return this, probably this router still has some software / hardware issues which I am not willing to deal with anymore. Specs on paper are extemely good for the given price point but product fails to delivers in real world. Most of the AI features are just gimmick, doesnt work in real life.For those confused by Negative Reviews and don't know whether to buy. Has been in a same situation before I bought. Router has no issues at all in anything. Following are the common complaints that all the people mentioned:1. Low download speeds2. High ping rates3. Rebooting issues4. Heating issuesMy experience initially:Got it in evening, called my ISP for I'd password and got MAC reset done by then so I can get new router connected. Setup through phone using Eagle Pro App, took hardly 10 minutes coz app is a bit buggy.Then comes the hard part. Speed on wifi is 20 Mbps, on a 300 Mbps connection, I am shocked to see it. Look at the router login and see the firmware version.Remedy: Router had firmware version as 1.4.4, due to my previous experience I knew that updating firmware to latest would most likely resolve the issues. So I search ""D-Link R15 Firmware"" in Google and first link has all the zip files. Download latest version i.e. 1.6.10. Extract the zip and you would get a bin file.Now go to router interface in system, Management and then to upgrade, click on advanced, select bin file and update. Would take few minutes and you have latest firmware. Now just to be sure, I reset the router to factory defaults by using reset button at back of router.It restarts and I do the configuration again. And now that I connect it to my ISP ont device I get close to 300 Mbps speed everytime.Nutshell: Update the firmware and you will get all that the specifications of this router promise.Haven't found any issues since 2 days, will update if I find any.Wanted to help those who are lured by Wifi 6 at such a reasonable price but are afraid that it might not work. So I am giving complete process here so no one holds back on buying this going by Negative Reviews. It's bang for the buck.

    I received this router last week which is also known as AX50. I was overexcited of getting WiFi 6 router. I overlooked some review on amazon about how it heats up when placed on flat surface and ordered myself as I needed a gigabyte router and thought to invest in the new technology. So far I can summarize some of the issues I came across on this router (I have around 10 Tp-link routers at this point, from cheapest to N to dual band.)1. It does heat up considerably from top and bottom middle portion. If I have to keep this router and no firmware can fix this, you have to install a PC cabinet fan under it to help remove the heat.2. This router doesn't provide Bridging/WDS functionality that all other routers that I have from tp-link has. Very disappointed as this functionality is present even in the least expensive tp-link router.3. The range of 2.4 GHz is no better than cheapest tp-link single band dual antenna that cost around 1000 rs has so disappointed with 2.4GHz WiFi performance.4. 5 GHz band is as usual have short range. The 5 GHz AC can connect to any device with a maximum of 1200 Mbps link speed, even if supported WiFi adapter maximum speed is higher to 1200mbps. If only AX mode is selected, router can connect to AX device to maximum of 2400 Mbps but it will not run AC mode. With mix mode with AC and AX, the maximum connection speed reduces to 1200 Mbps even for AX devices. So, this router is called AX router with 2400 Mbps for 5GHz or a AX router with 1200 Mbps that can connect to AC devices too, so it is misleading on part of TP-link. I shared the same on their forum but no response from their representative.5. Channel numbers for each band seems to change from those set in the admin configuration page after few session so if any bridge router connected to this AX router, it will disconnect.6. Ethernet Gigabit ports is maxing out at around 750 mbps read and 350 mbps write speed. I used CAT 7 cable to test the speed in my internal network. With a gigabit switch, I can get around 900mbps read and 600mbps write. Disappointed here too.7. AC wifi is maxing out at 22 MBps and 45 MBps in the internal network test.
